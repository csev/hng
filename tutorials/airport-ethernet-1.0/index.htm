Hopefully your system will find the base station.  If you cannot find the base station, check the Airport documentation on how to perform complete hardware resets.
<P>
If you cannot find the base station after a complete reset, recheck the installation in your computer and the software in your computer.

Base stations have a password - this keeps your neighbors from using the system and setting your parameters.
<P>
If you forget the password follow the hardware reset procedure in the Airport documentation.

This screen sets the identity of your wireless base station.  The <b>Severance_Home</b> network name will be used to distinguish among different Airport wireless networks.
<P>
In the TCP/IP configuration section, you are defining how the Airport will connect to the "non-wireless" network.  These settings should be as if the Airport was just another client on the "non-wireless" network.
<P>
In another example we will see configurations other than "Manually" - other options include <b>DHCP</b> and <b>PPP</b>.

This sets the wireless configuration.   If you enable encryption, your system will be more secure, but you will not be able to interoperate with a wide variety of non-Apple equipment.
<P>
Once you turn on encryption, you will have to enter a password each time your client systems are powered on or woke up after a suspend.
<P>
<b>Optimize placement</b> deals with multiple base stations and can generally be ignored.
