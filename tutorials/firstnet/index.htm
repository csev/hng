<h3>Setting up a Network with Two Windows-98 Computers</h3>
This case study assumes that you have two computers and would like to
connect them together to share files and printers.  This is a very simple
operation, and while this tutorial has a number of steps it can be done
in less than an hour.
<P>
This tutorial does not include the physical installation of the hardware.
It assumes that you have installed network cards in both computers,
connected them using two cables and a hub (make sure the hub is plugged in).
<P>
This tutorial begins when one of the computers is booted up and detects
the newly inserted network card.

Windows-98 has detected the card and will search for drivers.  At this point, you can press <b>Cancel</b> to skip this process and continue booting the system.  You can add the drivers later using the control panel or at a later re-boot.
<P>
In this example, we will press <b>Next</b>.

Generally you will allow Windows to search for the best drivers for the hardware.  You will later have a chance to install drivers from the floppy disk.
<P>
If you choose the second option, you will select the hardware from a list.  You will also have a chance to install your drivers from a disk using the second option.

We have our driver on a floppy disk, so we check the floppy-disk option.
<P>
Sometimes a driver is located in a subdirectory on the floppy (or CD-ROM) so you must use the <b>Browse</b> option to select the proper subdirectory.  Often directories are of the form <b>A:\WIN98\</b> or <b>A:\DRIVERS\WIN98\</b>.  Most vendors provide floppies or CD-ROM directory structures which can automatically be read by Windows.
<P>
Sometimes it is helpful to look through the media on another system to get a sense of the directory structure.  You are looking for files that look like <b>LNE100TX.INF</b>.  These INF files contain the information indicating which files must be installed for which pieces of hardware.

<!-- file:040founddriver-->
This floppy has the <B>INF</b> file in the root directory so it is automatically found.
<P>
If no driver is found, press the <b>Back</b> button and try again.  Ultimately you may have to press <b>Cancel</b> if you simply cannot find the driver.
<P>
In some cases, Windows may find a built-in driver for a card.  Some older cards have drivers included in the Windows-98 distribution media.  Also some newer cards are designed to emulate older cards such as the <b>NE2000</b> card.  If the card did not come with a driver disk at all, it is likely that it emulates some card that Windows-98 already supports.

<!-- file:050insertcd-->
In addition to the drivers for the card, Windows-98 notices that this is the first network card installed on the system and must install certain networking components to support the card.  This includes the TCP/IP software.
<P>
So you must insert the Windows-98 CD and press <b>OK</b>.

During the copy process, the installer may get confused and raise dialogs.  In this case, after copying some files from the Windows-98 CD-ROM, it is looking for the original driver from the floppy and cannot find it.  Simply re-select the <b>A:\</b> path from the drop down box.
<P>
This type of dialog may come up several times as the installer must switch media.  Simply read the directions and help the installer find the media.  If you make a mistake and select the wrong media, it will tell you and give you another chance.  If it is looking for something and you cannot help it find it, you may have to press <b>Cancel</b>.
<P>
Sometimes you can find some components in <b>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\</b> or <b>C:\WINDOWS\OPTIONS\CABS\</b> - this is especially true if you are reinstalling something and the files have already been installed once.

Once the system is back up and we have logged in properly, we go to

<P>
A number of components have been installed.  We see our new adapter and the TCP/IP protocol.  The TCP/IP protocol has been "bound" to both the dial-up adapter and our new network card.

Because we are going to be operating in a home network environment and only do file and print sharing, we are going to remove the TCP/IP protocol bound to the Network adapter.

Navigate until the vendor is <b>Microsoft</b> and the protocol is <b>NetBEUI</b>.

NetBEUI is a file and print sharing protocol developed by Microsoft which requires no configuration.  It is a very fast and efficient protocol which is very easy to use for small workgroups.

In business environments, either TCP/IP or Novell protocols may be used for file sharing, but they require more configuration.

When the computer reboots, you will be presented with a login screen.
<P>
There are two different screens used for log-in.  A "Windows" login (smaller screen with a windows logo) and a "Network" login.   You need to see the network login.  If you don't,
go to the <b>Network Control Panel</b> and make <B>Client for Microsoft Networks</b> the default login.
<P>
Also make sure to press <b>OK</b> or <b>Enter</b> at this screen - not <b>Escape</b>.  If you press <b>Escape</b>, you will not be logged in and file/print sharing will not work.
<P>

Now is the moment of truth.  On either computer (in this example I will use the downstairs computer).  Double click on <b>Network Neighborhood</b>.  If all goes well, you will see both computers.
<P>
If you cannot browse the network, re-check all the settings on both computers, re-check the hardware (do you have link-lights on the hub), and reboot the computers.
<P>
Other than hardware or connection problems, the most common problem is not logging in properly. Having the wrong type of login configured or pressing <b>Escape</b> at the login screen is a very common problem.
<P>
If you cannot browse the network, sometimes you can find a computer directly.  To do this, right-click on <b>Network Neighborhood</b>, select <b>Find Computer</b>, enter the computer name (upstairs) in the field, and press <b>Find</b>.  Sometimes you can communicate with a computer but cannot browse the network.

For a typical PC user, this is not much more complicated than installing a modem.  There are a few settings which may not be immediately obvious but this tutorial should show those settings.
