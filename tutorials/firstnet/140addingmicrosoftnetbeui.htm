Navigate until the vendor is <b>Microsoft</b> and the protocol is <b>NetBEUI</b>.
<P>
NetBEUI is a file and print sharing protocol developed by Microsoft which requires no configuration.  It is a very fast and efficient protocol which is very easy to use for small workgroups.
<P>
In business environments, either TCP/IP or Novell protocols may be used for file sharing, but they require more configuration.
<P>
Once you press <b>OK</b> be patient, after a few seconds, you will be brought back to the control panel screen.
