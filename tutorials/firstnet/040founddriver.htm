This floppy has the <B>INF</b> file in the root directory so it is automatically found.
<P>
If no driver is found, press the <b>Back</b> button and try again.  Ultimately you may have to press <b>Cancel</b> if you simply cannot find the driver.

In some cases, Windows may find a built-in driver for a card.  Some older cards have drivers included in the Windows-98 distribution media.  Also some newer cards are designed to emulate older cards such as the <b>NE2000</b> card.  If the card did not come with a driver disk at all, it is likely that it emulates some card that Windows-98 already supports.
