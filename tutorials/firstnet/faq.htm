<h3>FAQ For Setting Up Two Computers for Sharing</H3>

<b>
I think that the driver installation had a problem and would like-to redo it - how do I do this?
</b>
<p>
Go to <b> Start | Settings | Control Panel | System | Device Manager </b> find your network controller, select it and press <b>Remove</b>.  Then either shutdown to power off and restart the system or use the <b> Add New Hardware </b> wizard.  Shutting down is probably he best plan.

<b>
I cannot browse the network neightborhood - what happened?
</b>
<p>
That is a good question.  First reboot both computers, log into both, and try again.
Then go back through the tutorial checking every setting on both computers.  There are many reasons why this does not work, here is a partial list:
<ul>
<li>
Hardware problems - 
Make sure that the hardware has link lights on both network cards and the hub (this is a good reason to have a hub).  
<li>
Incorrect login - make sure that you are logged in using the "Client for Microsoft Networks" on both computers.  
<li>
When a computer has not indicated that it wants to give others access to its printers/files (the two check boxes) - it will not show up in a network neighborhood.
<li>
Network protocols not installed properly - feel free to remove protocols and re-add them from the network control panel.
</ul>
Often the problem is very small - before you start tearing things apart, just calmly go through all the settings and hardware connections.

How do I get rid of the Client For Microsoft Networks Login?
</b>
<p>
Before you installed networking, you may not have been prompted for a password.  
Now that it is installed you get a prompt - if you press Escape, networking does not work.  The following procedure should do the trick:
<pre>
Log in with an account name and no password by pressing OK
In Network Control panel switch to Windows Login
Reboot the system
At the windows login, enter the account with no password and press OK
When the system comes up, reboot again
The system should come up with out any prompt, but properly logged into the network.
</pre>
<p>
If in this process things get messed up, go in and remove the *.pwl files from the C:\WINDOWS\ directory, set the login to "Client for Microsoft Networks" and start over.
<p>
If things seem to get confused, switch to "Client for Microsoft Networks" log-in and just press enter at the login prompt and leave it this way.
<p>
Another approach is to download TweakUI from Microsoft and configure the login the way you want.
<p>
<b>
What are the PWL files?
</b>
<p>
These files store the login acounts and passwords for this particular windows machine.  It is quite safe to remove them from the C:\Windows directory to start with a clean slate.
