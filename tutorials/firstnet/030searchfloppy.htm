We have our driver on a floppy disk, so we check the floppy-disk option.
<P>
Sometimes a driver is located in a subdirectory on the floppy (or CD-ROM) so you must use the <b>Browse</b> option to select the proper subdirectory.  Often directories are of the form <b>A:\WIN98\</b> or <b>A:\DRIVERS\WIN98\</b>.  Most vendors provide floppies or CD-ROM directory structures which can automatically be read by Windows.
<P>
Sometimes it is helpful to look through the media on another system to get a sense of the directory structure.  You are looking for files that look like <b>LNE100TX.INF</b>.  These INF files contain the information indicating which files must be installed for which pieces of hardware.
