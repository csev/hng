Now is the moment of truth.  On either computer (in this example I will use the downstairs computer).  Double click on <b>Network Neighborhood</b>.  If all goes well, you will see both computers.
<P>
If you cannot browse the network, re-check all the settings on both computers, re-check the hardware (do you have link-lights on the hub), and reboot the computers.
<P>
Other than hardware or connection problems, the most common problem is not logging in properly. Having the wrong type of login configured or pressing <b>Escape</b> at the login screen is a very common problem.
<P>
If you cannot browse the network, sometimes you can find a computer directly.  To do this, right-click on <b>Network Neighborhood</b>, select <b>Find Computer</b>, enter the computer name (upstairs) in the field, and press <b>Find</b>.  Sometimes you can communicate with a computer but cannot browse the network.
