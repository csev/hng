During the copy process, the installer may get confused and raise dialogs.  In this case, after copying some files from the Windows-98 CD-ROM, it is looking for the original driver from the floppy and cannot find it.  Simply re-select the <b>A:\</b> path from the drop down box.

This type of dialog may come up several times as the installer must switch media.  Simply read the directions and help the installer find the media.  If you make a mistake and select the wrong media, it will tell you and give you another chance.  If it is looking for something and you cannot help it find it, you may have to press <b>Cancel</b>.

Sometimes you can find some components in <b>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\</b> or <b>C:\WINDOWS\OPTIONS\CABS\</b> - this is especially true if you are reinstalling something and the files have already been installed once.
