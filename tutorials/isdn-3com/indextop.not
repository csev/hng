This section describes some of the basic configuration screens for 
a popular ISDN modem/router - the 3Com OfficeConnect LanModem - also 
known as the 3C892.  This is a reliable piece of equipment for
connecting a small LAN to an ISDN ISP with a single account.
<p>
It does on-demand connections, but because ISDN connections are made in less
than five seconds, most users will not notice that any dialing has 
happened at all.  The only downside to an ISDN solution is typically the 
cost of the ISDN phone line.
