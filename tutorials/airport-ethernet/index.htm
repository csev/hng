Hopefully your system will find the base station.  If you cannot find the base station, check the Airport documentation on how to perform complete hardware resets.
<P>
If you cannot find the base station after a complete reset, recheck the installation in your computer and the software in your computer.

In a simple case, you will find a single base station - select the base station to configure it.

Base stations have a password - this keeps your neighbors from using the system and setting your parameters.
<P>
If you forget the password follow the hardware reset procedure in the Airport documentation.

This screen sets the identity of your wireless base station.  The <b>Severance_Home</b> network name will be used to distinguish among different Airport wireless networks.

Under the <b>Internet</b> tab you are defining how the Airport will connect to the "non-wireless" network.  These settings should be as if the Airport was just another client on the "non-wireless" network.
<p>
When you use some versions of the automatic setup of the base station these settings are copied from the Macintosh that is being used to configure the base station.   This is a good strategy - first you properly configure the base station for the network then you "transfer" that configuration to the base station.
<p>
Two other common configurations would be: <ul> <li> <b>Ethernet/DHCP</b> if you were installing this behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) box or if you had a ISP that gave you several IP addresses such as over a cable modem. <li> <b>PPP/DHCP</b> would be used if the system were to be connected using the modem connection. (described later). </ul>
<p>
See the <a href=../airport-modem/index.htm>Airport Modem Configuration</a>
section for a different set of example values.

This configures the network in which the wireless devices will operate.  As shown in this configuration, there will only be two computers in this network and they will have fixed IP addresses - in this configuration, the Airport or operating as a "rather transparent" gateway between the wireless space and the rest of the home network.
<p>
Sometimes DHCP and NAT does not work really well for protocols such as Microsoft File and print sharing so fixed addresses are better - however fixed addresses reduce flexibility and increase configuration effort.
<p>
A more common configutation choice here would be the <b>DHCP/NAT</b> option.

If you are in an area where other wireless equipment (802.11 compatible) , a simple approach to security is to exhaustively list the hardware addresses of the Airport adapters that this base station will service.  You can find this information on the control panel of the computer with the wireless card installed.
