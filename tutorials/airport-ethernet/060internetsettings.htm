Under the <b>Internet</b> tab you are defining how the Airport will connect to the "non-wireless" network.  These settings should be as if the Airport was just another client on the "non-wireless" network.
<p>
When you use some versions of the automatic setup of the base station these settings are copied from the Macintosh that is being used to configure the base station.   This is a good strategy - first you properly configure the base station for the network then you "transfer" that configuration to the base station.
<p>
Two other common configurations would be: <ul> <li> <b>Ethernet/DHCP</b> if you were installing this behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) box or if you had a ISP that gave you several IP addresses such as over a cable modem. <li> <b>PPP/DHCP</b> would be used if the system were to be connected using the modem connection. (described later). </ul>
<p>
See the <a href=../airport-modem/index.htm>Airport Modem Configuration</a>
section for a different set of example values.
