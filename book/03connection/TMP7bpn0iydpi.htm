<h1>Chapter 3: Home Internet Connection Choices</h1>
<p>As we've seen, home networking is all about sharing resources. Often, sharing 
  an Internet connection is a primary motivation behind building the home network 
  in the first place. This is especially true when a broadband Internet connection 
  such as cable modem or DSL serves the home, but Internet connection sharing 
  can be beneficial even if you are sharing an old-fashioned analog dial-up modem. 
<p>You may be pleasantly surprised by the performance you observe when sharing 
  a single Internet pipe among several home computers. Typically any single computer 
  connected to the Internet undergoes long periods in which it makes no use of 
  the Internet connection, with occasional bursts of usage. This pattern of heavy 
  use and idle periods means that four or five computers can effectively share 
  a single Internet connection, with all five users behaving as if they have dedicated 
  use of the connection. Of course, if Mandy is downloading MP3s while Mom is 
  downloading galleys of her next great American novel, the two users will notice 
  each other -- even perhaps if sharing a broadband pipe.
<p>Before we can share an Internet connection, we need to have one. This chapter 
  explores the various connection options available for your home Internet connection. 
  Once you've made your choice and gotten your connection operational, turn to 
  Chapter 5 to learn how to share the connection among all the computers in your 
  home.
<h2>Internet Pipes to the Home</h2>
<p> The Internet connection choices available to you vary based on where you live, 
  and what service providers have extended their service areas to cover your neighborhood. 
  Some choices are mainstream services available today; others are developing 
  options that may become practical in the future. The mainstream choices include:
<ul>
  <li>Analog modem over dial-up Telephone 
  <li>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 
  <li>Cable Modem 
  <li> Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) 
  <li>Satellite 
</ul>
<p>These mainstream choices are available to millions of current and potential 
  users. Not all of these are available in all areas yet, but the number of homes 
  potentially served grows each month. Also on the horizon are a number of alternative 
  Internet connection options in various stages of development, which could offer 
  competitive alternatives for connecting your home to the Internet. to the home 
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed Wireless 
  <li>Cellular phone based services 
  <li>Optical Wireless
  <li>Electrical power grid
  <li>Fiber optic cable (to the curb or to the home)<foot> </foot>
</ul>
<p><foot>For both mainstream and developing choices, the basic goal is to deliver 
  broadband Internet services without having to rewire the world. Thus most of 
  these technologies seek to use existing wiring, such as your existing telephone 
  line or your existing cable TV cabling. Wireless technologies, by definition, 
  don't need to run new wiring. Power grid schemes would use the electrical wires 
  that run through your neighborhood and into every room of your home. </foot><foot>By 
  contrast, fiber optic cables to your curb or to the home would require the expense 
  of running new cables the &quot;last mile&quot; to your home. This option, once 
  thought to be too expensive to justify, is now being deployed in some cities.</foot></p>
<p><foot>This chapter will help you gain some understanding of these technologies 
  so that you can make the best choice among alternatives that are available to 
  you. Some readers may want to make a quick decision or may already have selected 
  their preferred pipeline. If you are in a hurry the following chart helps you 
  see the advantages and disadvantages of the available mainstream choices. If 
  there is a little telecommunications engineer inside of you waiting to get out, 
  you'll want to read the detailed descriptions of all of the mainstream and developing 
  options later in the chapter.</foot><foot></foot></p>

<p>Note that our discussion of features and prices applies to service in the United 
  States. However these same technologies are being offered by various providers 
  in many nations worldwide; the technologies and underlying concepts are similar. 
</p>
<p>Now let's explore each connection option in more detail. Then we will consider 
  some aspects of the nature of broadband into the home, and some thoughts on 
  choosing an Internet service provider.</p>
<h2><foot></foot>Analog Dial-up Telephone Modem</h2>
<p>Even though millions of households have upgraded to broadband Internet service, 
  many areas are not yet served. And even in areas that have, for instance, cable 
  modem or DSL service, many customers may choose not to invest in the broadband 
  alternative. Thus, dial-up access to the Internet remains very widely used; 
  it is still the most common mode of connection to the Internet from homes. The 
  basic technology for a local dial-up telephone call has changed very little 
  over the decades; it is sometimes called &quot;Plain Old Telephone Service&quot; 
  or POTS.</p>
<p>As interactive computer terminals became popular in the Seventies, people wanted 
  to connect to remote mainframes without requiring a dedicated data link. The 
  dial-up telephone modem was the answer. People could dial into remote computers 
  from homes or remote offices using the same telephone service they already had 
  installed. A modem (short for &quot;modulator-demodulator&quot;) turns data 
  (0's and 1's) into sound, sends the sound through a telephone connection, and 
  converts the sound back to data at the far end. The birth of the PC two decades 
  ago was soon followed by the introduction of the venerable Hayes Smartmodem 
  and dial-up computing became a popular activity. Back then, people dialed from 
  homes into office modem pools or into dial-up Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes); 
  today, the home user typically dials into a local Internet Service Provider's 
  modem pool.</p>
<p>These days, most new computers on the market have built-in analog telephone 
  modems. For desktop computers the modem is typically an <i>internal modem -- 
  </i>a circuit card pre-installed in an expansion slot inside the PC. For laptop 
  computers, the modem may be built into the core circuitry of the PC, with a 
  standard RJ-11 telephone jack provided adjacent to other laptop ports. </p>
<p>If a PC you wish to use for dial-up access lacks a modem, you can either buy 
  and install an internal modem, or you may opt for an external modem. External 
  modems are standalone devices with their own power supplies. External modems 
  traditionally connect to the PC over a standard serial (RS-232) cable. A more 
  recent alternative is a USB (universal serial bus) external modem, which connects 
  to a USB port on the PC. </p>
<p>External modems have some advantages. The indicator lights on the modem give 
  you more information about connection status and wheter data is flowing. It's 
  a lot easier to move an external modem from one computer to another. If something 
  goes wrong with the modem, you can replace it or send it for repair more conveniently.</p>
<p>But internal modems have advantages. They don't take up desk space. They require 
  no extra cabling; you plug the phone line into the PC. You don't need a separate 
  power cord. Internal modems perform slightly faster because they avoid the extra 
  overhead and latency inherent in moving your data over a serial cable into your 
  computer. People who play real-time interactive games may notice the difference, 
  but most mortals will not.</p>
<p>If you are adding a modem to an existing laptop computer, typically you will 
  buy and install a card modem in a spare PC Card slot. In the interest of portability, 
  external modems are seldom paired with laptops.</p>
<p> To better understand how the analog modems work, let's examine an early modem. 
<p> <b><font color="#FF0000">[Picture of an Early Modem (010)]</font></b> 
<p> Anyone who has ever used an analog telephone modem is familiar with the chirps 
  and warbles that are emitted as your calling modem places the call and then 
  negotiates a connection with the remote modem being called. Over the years there 
  have been a number of standards for modem connection speeds; most modern modems 
  can communicate with a wide range of older modems. (Today's modems follow an 
  international standard called V.90.) When a modem initially connects, if its 
  speaker is turned on, you hear a series of tones. The two modems attempt to 
  negotiate the highest-speeed connection they can manage, based on each modem's 
  capability and the condition of the telephone connection between them. It can 
  take nearly a minute until the sending modem "guesses" the right tone of an 
  older receiving modem. 
<p>Figure of POTS (020) 
<p> The connection speed you can achieve over a dial-up modem is subject to the 
  basic limitations of the medium. Telephones have limited fidelity when it comes 
  to the quality of sound that is transmitted from one phone to the other. Analog 
  telephone lines convey human voice at a level of quality that has not changed 
  much in 100 years of telephony; they are limited to a frequency range of 3000 
  Hz. Thus, modems operate under a fundamental limit of 2400 &quot;baud&quot; 
  (or 2400 signalling elements per second). Using sophisticated digital signal 
  processing, we can send up to 56,000 bits per second through this audio channel. 
  (Actually, Federal Communications Commission rules limit downlink speed on a 
  telephone modem to 53 kilobits/second.) Unfortunately, achieving this maximum 
  rate depends on a very clean telephone line and good connection. 
<p>Unfortunately, people living in older homes or neighborhoods, or people in 
  rural areas, may find that their telephone lines do not allow their analog modems 
  to connect at the highest rated speeds. Often in such cases your modem will 
  &quot;fall back&quot; to connecting at 28.8 or 33.6 kilobits/second. Analog 
  modems are slow enough; falling back to half speed is painful. The problem may 
  lie in your internal house wiring, or the wiring between your house and a telephone 
  pole, or the wiring back to the telephone company central office. Usually it's 
  not easy to convince the local telephone company to do anything about it; they 
  will tell you their job is to deliver reasonable voice service. Sometimes, if 
  you order a second phone line, the new wiring will behave better.
<p>In today's world of graphics-rich Web pages and multimegabyte software downloads, 
  the analog modem is beginning to show its age. Many users who grow frustrated 
  with the &quot;World Wide Wait&quot; leap at the opportunity to move up to broadband 
  when it's offered to their home. Dial-up modems users also suffer with busy 
  signals when the Internet Service Provider's modem pool is fully occupied -- 
  and of course there is the long wait for dialing and negotiating every time 
  you want to use the Internet.
<p> Even with these limitations, standard telephone modems are by far the most 
  common way home users connect to the Internet. Many homes will share a single 
  telephone line for voice and Internet applications; others may choose to invest 
  in a second line, typically at a cost of about $20 per month including taxes 
  and fees. Dial-up Internet services that are not subsidized by advertising typically 
  run about $22 per month for unlimited usage. Thus the total cost of Internet 
  service for many dial-up users is about $42.00 per month. 
<p>When you dial into an ISP using a telephone modem, your Internet traffic is 
  carried using a special protocol called PPP, for &quot;Point to Point Protocol.&quot; 
  Traditionally Internet traffic us conveyed by TCP/IP. PPP provides a way to 
  package traditional TCP/IP traffic for a connection from one point -- your home 
  -- to another point -- your ISP. Support for TCP/IP and PPP has been built into 
  Windows since Windows 95, and the Macintosh since System 7.
<p>Some users who cannot abide the slowness of a 56K Internet connection take 
  advantage of a fairly recent innovation: &quot;modem doubling.&quot; Under modem 
  doubling, two POTS lines are used to connect to the ISP. Because two lines are 
  consumed both at home and at the ISP, you share the bandwidth of both phone 
  lines, allowing a theoretical throughput of over 100 kilobits/second. One approach 
  to this is &quot;modem bonding,&quot; which exploits two modems each using its 
  own phone line. Dedicated modems capable of modem bonding are smart enough to 
  use the two phone lines intelligently; if one line is used for a voice call, 
  the modem degrades to one-line mode gracefully, and resumes two-line use when 
  the voice call is completed. One manufacturer of such smart modems is Diamond, 
  which offers a &quot;Supra&quot; line of modem-doubling modems.. (Many ISPs 
  charge for use of the second line required for modem bonding; after all, you 
  are using two of their phone lines and modems, potentially tying up a line another 
  user needs.)
<p>If you do not have a modem with built-in modem-bonding capacity, you can still 
  achieve modem bonding through software. You will use two inexpensive modems 
  (either internal or external modems) each connected to its own telephone line. 
  An Internet standard called Multilink PPP (sometimes called &quot;MP&quot;) 
  defines the rules. All versions of Windows since Windows 98 support modem bonding 
  through Multilink. You can configure Windows Multilink to dial the second connection 
  when activity on your first connection exceeds a chosen percent of utilization; 
  you can also configure Multilink to hang up the second connection if activity 
  falls below a certain level. Macintosh users who wish to explore software modem 
  bonding may wish to consider a third-party product called LinkUPPP! Turbo. A 
  driver called &quot;Equalizer&quot; is available for Linux modem bonding.

<p>
<h3>ISDN</h3>
<p> Plain old telephone service (POTS) dates back to the origins of the telephone 
  at the beginning of the twentieth century. In the 1960's the telephone companies 
  in the United States and elsewhere began converting their long distance networks 
  to use digital transmission technologies, and began installing digital switches 
  in local central offices. But the telephone line that runs from the central 
  office to your house remained the familiar analog Plain Old Telephone Service. 
  ISDN was designed to migrate homes and offices from analog to digital services. 
  Thus the new service was called "Integrated Services Digital Network" or ISDN. 
  Instead of encoding data as analog sound signals, ISDN is digital. 
<p>The ISDN service offering typically used in home and small business applications 
  provides two 64 kilobit/second data channels and one 16 kilobit/second signaling, 
  or &quot;control,&quot; channel. This is known in ISDN parlance as a &quot;Basic 
  Rate Interface&quot; or &quot;BRI&quot; service. The 64 kilobit/second channels 
  are known as &quot;B&quot; channels and the signaling channel is called a &quot;D&quot; 
  channel; thus BRI service is sometimes called &quot;2B+D.&quot; The bottom line 
  is that BRI ISDN offers home users up to 128 kilobits/second of reliable data 
  capacity.
<p>The term &quot;ISDN&quot; also applies to service offerings seldom used for 
  homes. One service is called PRI or Primary Rate Interface. It offers 23 data 
  channels at 64 Kbps each, and one signaling channel at 16 Kbps. PRI service 
  usually costs far more per month than most households would be willing to pay. 
<p>Another term you may encounter is &quot;Broadband ISDN&quot; or B-ISDN. This 
  standard provides for integrating voice, data, video, Internet, and other content 
  over high-speed telephone links all the way into the home. Speeds of up to 1.5 
  megabits/second are envisioned. At 128 kilobits/second, basic ISDN does not 
  meet the FCC definition of a broadband service. At B-ISDN speeds you can begin 
  to think about moving full-frame video images over phone lines. Telephone companies 
  and others talk about B-ISDN a great deal, but it is not widely deployed. The 
  rest of our discussion assumes basic, or BRI, ISDN into the home.
<p> The ISDN connection essentially extends the functionality of the telephone 
  company's digital network into the home. Each of the data channels can either 
  carry a phone conversation or a data connection. To carry a phone conversation, 
  sound is digitized by special "packet telephones" which were to be installed 
  in the customer's homes. The designers of ISDN envisioned a wider range of digital 
  telephony gadgets. Unfortunately, that never really came to pass. Some people 
  claim that ISDN was priced too high; others feel that in 1980, we did not yet 
  possess enough technology to develop and manufacture packet telephones at a 
  reasonable price. Regardless of the reasons, ISDN was not readily available 
  until the mid-1990's. By then, the Internet revolution had occurred; data connections 
  had become "packet oriented" rather than "connection oriented."
<p> There are two basic ways to utilize an ISDN connection to the home:
<ul>
  <li>An <b>ISDN modem</b> operates much the same as a traditional analog dial-up 
    modem. Just as with analog modems, ISDN modems can be external (standalone 
    box with its own power supply that connects by an interface cable to the PC) 
    or internal (a card you install in a spare expansion slot inside the PC). 
    Versions of Windows since '98 have built-in support for ISDN modems. (We use 
    the term &quot;modem&quot; here somewhat loosely, because an ISDN line is 
    by definition already digital; your Internet data is not converted from digital 
    to analog. A more proper term might be &quot;DSU,&quot; or &quot;Data Service 
    Unit.&quot; But &quot;ISDN modem&quot; is used commonly, so we'll use the 
    term as well.)
  <li>The ISDN line can also be connected to an <b>ISDN router</b> which is stand-alone 
    unit. 3Com Corporation pioneered the concept of an easily-configured ISDN 
    router that could serve as a connection point for more than one home computer; 
    now a number of competitive products are on the market. A typical ISDN router 
    will have a connection for the ISDN phone line, two POTS connections, and 
    several Ethernet ports. 
</ul>
Most ISDN modems and ISDN routers provide connections to support standard telephone 
equipment. You plug your telephone into a conventional RJ-11 telephone jack. Then 
you use the telephone as if it were connected to a conventional POTS line. Each 
if the 64Kb connections is assigned its own telephone number. When you pick up 
an analog phone and dial a remote phone number, you hear the dial tone and the 
touch tones, but the telephone network never does. The ISDN modem or router actually 
generates the dial-tone that you hear in the handset. As you press keys, the router 
interprets the tones your phone generates, and translates your keystrokes into 
a digital call setup conveyed over the 16Kb control channel. When the connection 
is established, the router is notified on the control channel, and digitized sound 
begins to flow over one of the 64Kb channels. The ISDN router converts the sounds 
to and from digital form and acts as a bridge between the analog handset and the 
digital connection to the telephone company. When calling from an ISDN connected 
phone, you can dial <i>any</i> other phone on the global telephone network. If 
the destination phone is connected via a POTS connection, the phone company makes 
the necessary conversions between analog and digital. 
<p> <font color="#FF0000"><b>Picture of the ISDN router and analog phone </b></font>
<p><img src="060isdnchart.jpg" width="464" height="193">
<p>
When you have an ISDN modem or router in your home, many of the functions that were formerly done in the telephone company central office are actually done in your ISDN equipment. This allows significant flexibility in several ways.  
<p> When the ISDN router or ISDN modem is used for data, at least one of the 64Kb 
  connections is dialed to your Internet Service Provider (who also has an ISDN 
  connection). This connection is a direct digital connection which yeilds an 
  error-free 64Kbs. Generally, the PPP (Point-to-Point) protocol operates over 
  this connection. PPP handes both the initial authentication and the data transfer 
  over the link. 
<p>ISDN can be used in either an &quot;on-demand&quot; mode, or for a full-time 
  connection. Because it is digital, ISDN doesn't require the labrorious negotiations 
  that analog modems require to set up a session. In fact, you can use an ISDN 
  link in on-demand mode and treat it virtually as if it were an &quot;always-on&quot; 
  full time connection; call setup normally takes just a few seconds. Users with 
  home office applications may wish to move up to a full-time connection. Your 
  ISP may charge a premium for this service.
<p><img src="056multilinkisdn3com.gif" width="400" height="234">
<p> Just as it is possible to exploit two analog modems over analog POTS service, 
  it's also possible to combine both 64K ISDN channels in order to achive a 128 
  Kilobits/second connection from your home to the Internet.You can use Multi-link 
  PPP just as you might use it for analog dial-up modems.
<ul>
  <li>Using <b>ISDN Bonding</b>, when the connection is made, both lines are dialed 
    at the same time and "bonded" to form a 128Kb/sec connection. A simple way 
    to thing of this is to imaging that every other bit is sent down the other 
    conection and then the bits are re-interleaved at the other end. The resulting 
    stream is 128Kb/sec through the modem 
  <li>With <b>Multi-Link PPP</b>, both connections are dialed separately. In theory, 
    they could even dial different ISPs, though this is quite rare in practice. 
    Multilink PPP is capable of dynamically adding the second channel when traffic 
    requirements demand, or removing the second channel as link activity declines. 
    Or, if you pick up a telephone connected to your ISDN modem, either to make 
    an outgoing call or to receive an incoming call, the second channel can graceful 
    switch to your voice use; the only impact is that during the voice call only 
    one channel is available to move Internet traffic. (As a matter of fact, you 
    could even dial a voice call and get a busy signal, and hang up the phone, 
    without ever affecting the data flowing on either 64Kb channel; your attempt 
    to place the call is carried over the 16Kb data channel.) When both channels 
    are available and you are moving lots of data, such as during a download of 
    a large file, you can achieve the full 128 kilobits/second implied by two 
    64 kilobits/second channels.
</ul>
:ISDN Bonding is typically used when ISDN is used for a full-time connection. 
In that case, you want both channels permanently dedicated to your Internet traffic. 
For the on-demand dial-up situation, Multilink PPP is more common. In any event, 
you will want to consider the service plans of potential ISPs before investing 
in ISDN equipment or deciding how you plan to configure your ISDN setup. 
<p> In summary, an ISDN connection into your home typically provides the following:
<ul>
<li>Two phone numbers which can be used with standard analog telephone equipment
<li>A data connection which operates at either 64Kb or 128KB/sec (typically based on traffic usage)
  <li>An Internet connection which connects in about 3 seconds (depending on your 
    ISP) so it feels like it is always on 
  <li>Multilink capabilities so that when you want to use the phone, your data
connection just slows down a little bit
</ul>
Some people order ISDN and use it as their only phone connection. This can be 
dangerous; if the ISDN router loses power, you cannot make telephone calls. During 
a power outage you might not be able to make a necessary call in case of emergency. 
So if you are considering an ISDN as your sole home telephone service, make sure 
to keep your router on an uninterruptible power supply that can operate the unit 
for several days. (Some people may feel a cell or PCS phone is an adequate backup, 
but these too can lose service in case of neighborhood power outages.) Another 
approach is to have one standard phone line and a second ISDN line. While this 
is somewhat costly, the end result is three phone numbers in your home. You have 
confidence of being able to use the POTS line in case of emergency, as it is powered 
at the telephone company central office with battery backup. 
<p> Unfortunately, ISDN often is not priced competitively when you consider the 
  amount of bandwidth you receive per dollar spent. Your phone company may charge 
  $40 to $50 per month for your ISDN line. In addition, your Internet Service 
  Provider may charge a premium to allow you to use ISDN; it is typical to pay 
  $30 or more to an ISP for unlimited ISDN service. Other ISPs may charge an hourly 
  rate for ISDN -- and double the fee if you use both 64K channels. This brings 
  the overall cost to use ISDN to nearly $80 per month. And some ISPs add bandwidth 
  metering on top of these fees! 
<p>You also need to consider one-time costs. Your telephone company may charge 
  a fee to install your ISDN line. Installation fees may apply to work at thecentral 
  office and on your own telephone line. Fees of $200 are typical. Your ISDN modem 
  will cost about $200 to $300.
<p>Given these prices for one-time setup and per month, ISDN is usually a poor 
  alternative to cable modem or DSL service when those alternatives are available 
  to you. Many commentators feel ISDN is a service that came too late and now 
  offers too little for the price. Nonetheless, in many rural areas or other broadband-deprived 
  locales, ISDN may be the best option to connect to the Internet at speeds faster 
  than a telephone modem. For some home users, ISDN is the right choice.

<p>
<h3>Cable Modem</h3>
<p> In the early 1990's, cable television companies began to experiment with and 
  deploy networking solutions based on the CATV connections into many urban and 
  suburban homes. The basic idea of a cable modem is to leverage the existing 
  cable that runs into your home. The very same cable can deliver Home Box Office 
  and 100 other channels as well as provide a high-speed, two-way Internet connection. 
  Cable modems accomplish this by using one or more channels of spectrum on the 
  cable to carry your Internet traffic. 
<p>A cable modem connection is &quot;always on.&quot; You do not endure the long 
  negotiations that dial-up modems must perform, or even the three second delay 
  of on-demand ISDN service. Your cable modem service fee includes your Iinternet 
  connection and back-end services such as e-mail boxes and access to Usenet News; 
  no fees are necessary for an additional ISP. Cable modem service closely resembles 
  having a connection that functions like a local area network connected via a 
  high-speed link. In fact, some customers operate small business servers over 
  their home-based cable modems. (Most cable companies charge more for service 
  plans that allow customers to operate servers over the cable plant. For reliability 
  and performance reasons, we suggest that small business operators generally 
  eshew running a Web server over a home cable modem connection.) 
<p> Cable modems make efficient use of existing broadband wiring into the home. 
  To make cable modems work, engineers had to overcome a number of challenges. 
  The first challenge is the fact that cable television distribution technology 
  was always designed to carry information in one direction: broadcast from an 
  origination point (called the "head-end") to subscribers' homes. In order to 
  keep from running thosands of individual cable connections from each house to 
  the head-end, the cable system is designed as a multi-level tree. 
<p> <img align=right src=040cableoneway.gif alt="One-Way Cable Plant"> Between 
  the head-end and the subscriber, the signal is split several times. Each time 
  it is split, the signal is cleaned-up, adjusted and amplified. A cable company 
  needs to spend significant effort making sure that their amplifiers are properly 
  adjusted to insure that each subscriber had a high-quality signal. 
<p> In order to transform cable plants to support Internet traffic and other two-way 
  services, cable companies had to undertake significant upgrade projects. In 
  a two-way system, the amplifiers must take a subset of the channels coming <i>back</i> 
  from the subscriber's homes and pass that channel back up the tree. At a minimum, 
  this requires the replacement of all the amplifiers in the cable television 
  system. Furthermore, it is necessary to make sure that the cable system is very 
  carefully adjusted and monitored. A bad signal or badly tuned amplifier in a 
  one-way system may affect as few as ten homes. On the other hand, when there 
  is a bad signal in the uplink channel, it corrupts the channel as it is propogated 
  up the cable system. 
<p> Once the cable plant has been upgraded to allow one or more television channels 
  to be two-way, there is still the detail as to how we move network data across 
  television channels. At its most basic, a cable modem is indeed a "modem;" data 
  is converted from digital to analog before being transmitted over an analog 
  medium. Just as dial-up telephone modems allow digital traffic to be carried 
  over analog voice-grade phone lines, cable modems allow digital traffic to be 
  carried over analog broadband cable TV cables. In a way, the cable modem in 
  your home is a small television station. It is able to insert an analog signal 
  onto the cable on its assigned TV channel, and it is able to split off the analog 
  signal from an assigned channel and convert it to digital data for delivery 
  into your home.
<p>Besides handling the basic conversion from digital to analog and back, the 
  cable modem, we also must arbitrate among the different cable modems in your 
  neighborhood so that only one cable modem transmits at any given moment. You 
  and your neighbors share the same assigned TV channels for your cable Internet 
  traffic. If two cable modems transmit at the same time, their signals would 
  collide and no data would be transmitted. The collision might even produce noise 
  on other channels on the cable. Two cable modems transmitting at the same time 
  could conceivably cause your neighbor to see a bad signal while watching their 
  soccer game. 
<p> This arbitration is resolved using a protocol called "token bus". No station 
  is allowed to transmit until it has been told that it has permission - known 
  in industry vernacular as is the "token." If you have the token, you can transmit; 
  otherwise you must hold onto your data and remain silent. The network insures 
  that the token will be passed around in an equitable manner, so that even under 
  heavy load from several modems, each modem will have an opportunity to transmit 
  many times per second. 
<p> Cable modem technology may sound complicated. It is. But most of the Internet 
  technologies we rely on in our offices are also complicated, even though we 
  expect them to be highly reliable. A well-built and well-maintained two-way 
  cable system with broadband Internet services can also provide extremely high 
  reliability. 
<p> If cable modems are in your area, we strongly uggest you consider availing 
  yourself of the service. Cable modems provide a high speed, always-on Internet 
  connection for prices typically in the range of $30 and $50. There is no need 
  for a second phone line, and there are no ISP busy signals. If you consider 
  the cost of an ISP and a second phone line, a cable modem provides a much better 
  experience at about the same cost. 
<h2>DSL - Digital Subscriber Line</h2>
<p>Like ISDN, Digital Subscriber Line technology comes from the telephone company. 
  Like ISDN, DSL's goal is to use existing telephone wiring to move data at speeds 
  far faster than analog modems can achieve. But DSL was born much later than 
  ISDN. DSL is designed to operate in a world that assumes the Internet, demands 
  high speed, and assumes that the data connection is always on. </p>
<p>Like cable modems, DSL operates over wiring that is already connected to your 
  house. In the case of DSL, this wiring is the existing telephone connection. 
  With cable modems, you share bandwidth of one or more cable channels that have 
  been dedicated to carrying Internet data. With DSL, as with analog dial-up modems 
  or ISDN, you use the same phone line that is dedicated to your use all the way 
  from your home to the phone company central office.</p>
<p> <img align=right src=050phonecopper.gif alt="wiring to the central office"> 
  By running all of the wires all the way back to the central office, the telephone 
  company can deploy new services to your home simply by changing the equipment 
  that your wires are plugged into (and changing how much you are billed each 
  month). Consider an example. Homes A and B have POTS, while C has ISDN, and 
  D has ADSL. Homes A and B use conventional analog telephone equipment available 
  at very low prices. Homes C and D need special equipment, which costs considerably 
  more, to make use of the advanced services of ISDN or DSL.
<p>While having a direct connection from your home to the phone office is a seeming 
  advantage when deploying network services, making DSL work has taken a significant 
  amount of effort because of the limitations of a long, unshielded pair of copper 
  wires when used for data communications. The copper wiring installed in most 
  of the country to support POTS is a very simple kind of cable. An analog telephone 
  is a relatively undemanding devices - basically a microphone and a speaker. 
<p> If we move data across your copper telephone wires at higher speeds, the wires 
  become radio antennae. The signals begin to leak out of the wires. This has 
  two bad side effects. With too much leakage, a high frequency signal sent through 
  the wires does not come out the other end, because it has all leaked out. The 
  second problem is what happens when all this leakage occurs. Your leaked signal 
  ends up in nearby wires and devices, causing interference that can frustrate 
  you or upset your neighbors. These facts of signal transmission impose distance 
  and traffic limitations on DSL.
<p> The farther away your home is from the neighborhood telephone company central 
  office, the slower the maximum data rate you can achieve over DSL. If you are 
  too far from the central office, DSL simply won't be available to you. Thus 
  when you explore DSL services on a provider's Web site, you are quickly asked 
  for your precise street address. The provider has a very detailed national database 
  that knows how far each address resides from the central office that serves 
  it. Consider how distance affects possible DSL speeds:
<p>
<pre>
Distance (feet)     Maximum Speed (upstream+downstream)
18000                1.544 Mbps
9000                 6.1 Mbps
</pre>
<p>The most common DSL service offering marketed to homes in the United States 
  operates at 768 kilobits/second kilobits/second downstream (into the home). 
  This speed happens to be about one-half 1.54 Mbps. The typical upstream speed 
  is about 128 kilobits/second. Most home users find that they download far more 
  data than they upload. After all, if you are surfing the Web, your upload traffic 
  consists of URLs that are no more than a couple of hundred characters each. 
  The pages you download are usually many thousands of bytes. However, it is worth 
  noting that an upstream speed of 128 kilobits/second does not meet the FCC definition 
  of broadband.</p>
<p>It is not generally practical to get DSL if you are farther than 18000 feet 
  from the central office. This limitation can be overcome with amplifiers, or 
  with recent advancements that move DSL interface equipment out of the central 
  office and into neighborhood cabinets that are closer to your home. You won't 
  be able to determine if you can get DSL by using your trip odometer to measure 
  the distance to your central office; you are at the mercy of the phone company's 
  database. </p>
<p> Even if your neighborhood has brand new wiring and is less than a mile from 
  the central office, not all central offices have the apropriate equipment installed 
  in the central office. As demand increases, DSL deployment in central offices 
  (and therefore the neighborhoods they serve) increase. Also, broadband providers 
  tend to respond to competition. When cable modems or other high speed Internet 
  alternatives appear in an area, DSL also tends to appear.
<p> One of the slickest engineering achievements in DSL is the fact that a single 
  copper pair can both be used as POTS line <i>and</i> as an ADSL line at the 
  same time. This is done using different frequencies for the POTS signal and 
  the ADSL signal. The POTS signal is sound and operates at below 5Khz. The ADSL 
  data is modulated so that it starts well above the voice signals. Both signals 
  are combined onto the same wires. At the receiving end, a simple analog filter 
  (an inductor and a capacitor) is used to separate the signals. In contrast to 
  ISDN, there is no degradation of data signals when you initiate or receive an 
  analog voice call.
<p> Another advantage of DSL over ISDN is the fact that DSL is &quot;always on.&quot; 
  DSL compares favorably with cable modems in this regard. When you want to surf 
  the Web or send e-mail, you do not have to worry about connection delays or 
  busy signals.
<p>In most locations, DSL services ranges from $40 to $60 depending of competition, 
  regulation,and the options that you choose. In most cases, your DSL service 
  cost includes back-end Internet services; your DSL provider becomes your ISP. 
  Thus your cost of DSL is inclusive; there is no need to pay an extra $20 per 
  month for a separate ISP. DSL can offer far faster service than ISDN at lower 
  prices and with the reliability of POTS in case of emergency. 
<p>In the United States, your DSL provider could be the local telephone company, 
  sometimes called a Baby Bell or your &quot;Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier.&quot; 
  A number of &quot;Competitive Local Exchange Carriers&quot; also compete for 
  your Internet connection dollars. The Web site DSLRreports.com is an excellent 
  resource for learning about DSL providers. The site allows you to enter your 
  own address and phone number, and see which Baby Bells and which other providers 
  compete to serve you.
<p>DSL can also be very cost-effective compared to cable modems. Pricing tends 
  to be the same for both services. Telephone companies like to claim that DSL 
  is inherently superior to cable modems because the latter shares bandwidth among 
  all subscribers in a neighborhood. This claim is misleading. Cable modems tend 
  to move data at speeds of 1 to 10 megabits/second. Crude analysis might take 
  this to mean that only a handful of neighbors can share a cable line. But usage 
  patterns vary; most of the time, some users are idle. A well-designed and managed 
  cable plant can deliver service superior to a competitive DSL service. The real 
  issue is not inherent differences between DSL and cable. The real difference 
  is which provider, the telephone company or the cable company, has the technical 
  staff and corporate commitment to being a good ISP.
<p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<h3>Satellite</h3>
<p> Satellite-based Internet connections for the home come in two forms: 
<ul>
<li>One-way with telephone company return
<li>Two-way satellite service
</ul>
<p>With the first option, the data coming to your home -- the &quot;downstream&quot; 
  traffic -- comes in through the satellite dish at fairly high speed. The data 
  that you send to the network -- your &quot;upstream&quot; traffic -- is carried 
  over a conventional analog modem via your telephone line. Such a configuration 
  is sometimes called &quot;dialup return&quot; or &quot;telco return.&quot; If 
  your upstream traffic consists primarily of things you type -- e-mail, instant 
  messages, URLs in your Web browser -- then you may find this configuration acceptable. 
  On the other hand, if you regularly upload large files, you are limited to the 
  speeds of any other dial-up modem configuration.</p>
<p><img src="085-direcpc1way.jpg" width="400" height="287"></p>
<p>Telco return also requires that you have an account with a dial-up Internet 
  Service Provider, and that you install specialized software on your PC to handle 
  the specialized routing of your Internet traffic. Support may not be available 
  for your type of computer; for instance, DirecPC satellite service only works 
  on Windows computers. You need a special &quot;dual-LNB&quot; dish that's wider 
  and taller than the 18&quot; dishes used for television-only applications in 
  North America. Given these complications and limitations, satellite with Telco 
  return will probably appeal mostly to homes that lack access to cable modem 
  or DSL service.</p>
<p>Two-way satellite is now available as an alternative. The service costs more 
  to install and more per month than the telco return approach, while providing 
  higher-speed uplink, &quot;always-on&quot; service, and no need to tie up a 
  phone line or have a separate dial-up ISP account. </p>
<p><img src="090-direcpc2waytext.jpg" width="400" height="285"></p>
<p>Most satellite broadband subscribers choose to have a technician do the installation, 
  although it is possible for someone who is savvy with tools and technology to 
  do her own. For two-way satellite service, though, the FCC requires that a technician 
  perform the installation. Satellite providers warn that their services are intended 
  for residences that stay in one spot. Recreational vehicles are not supported.</p>
<p>Satellite Internet services can easily provide coverage in far-flung small 
  towns and rural areas that are not served by terrestrial competitors. All a 
  given subscriber needs is an unobstructed view of the southern sky.</p>
<p>Real time games don't work well over satellite links. The section on &quot;latency&quot; 
  later in this chapter explains why.</p>
<p>The main providers of satellite broadband Internet service in the United States 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hughes Network Systems, with its DirecPC (telco return) and DirecWay (satellite) 
    products, which are sold to consumers by companies such as AOL, Earthlink, 
    and Juno. Satellite equipment costs about $500 and installation about $200, 
    with monthly service fees of about $70. The satellite modem plugs into a USB 
    port on the PC. Only Windows is supported.</li>
  <li> Starband service, developed by an Israeli company called Gilat. Starband 
    is markted by the Dish Network and by Primus. Starbamd is a two-way service. 
    The company claims download speeds from 150 kilobits/second to 500 kilobits/second, 
    with upload speeds of 40-60 kbps. Home interface equipment costs about $500; 
    installation is about $200, and monthly fees are about $70. The company gears 
    the service towards home users running Windows computers. Starband is able 
    to serve customers in Alaska who install a special receiving dish -- a real 
    boon for the broadband-deprived in the tundra. Normally the satellite modem 
    connects to a PC via a USB port. As of this writing, Microsoft and Radio Shack 
    also offer Starband service bundled with the purchase of a special Compaq 
    computer.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fixed Wireless</h2>
<p> Fixed high speed wireless solutions are available in a small, but growing, 
  number of communities. These services typically are using the 2.4Ghz or 5.4Ghz 
  frequencies. These frequencies are unlicensed, but equipment operating in these 
  frequencies must follow certain power rules and tolerate interference from other 
  equipment operating in the same frequency. These solutions can provide from 
  0.5 - 20Mb/sec connectivity at a cost comparable to DSL or cable modem. 
<p> It will take some time to see if fixed wireless expands beyond its core markets 
  of: 
<ul>
  <li> Suburban areas with a high density of hi-tech workers 
  <li> Rural areas with moderate population density which are not suitable for 
    Cable Television. 
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, fixed wireless may be viable as a long-term direct competitor to 
  cable modem and DSL. Wireless has the advantage that it has fewer legal barriers 
  than DSL or cable based solutions but it will be a challenge for it to scale 
  in terms of bandwidth in highly populated areas. If you have access to fixed 
  wireless in your community, you should take a close look at it. </p>
<h2>Optical Wireless</h2>
<h2>Cellular Wireless Services</h2>
Cellular services fall into two basic categoories:
<ul>
<li>Analog-style connection oriented access
<li>CDPD - Cellular Digital Packet Data
</ul>
It has been possible to use a cellular telephone to make a "call" and transfer data similar to an analog modem.  Initially this was limited to 2400bps, but with improving technology and digital phones, the speeds are approaching 56kbps.  The cost of using this type of service is usually based on the minutes of used charged at the cellular rate in your cellular plan.  There may be a monthly charge to allow data services in some pricing plans.  This approach has very complete coverage, but it is not really practical when compared to a standard telephone line for home use.
<p>
A more exciting cellular technology is Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD).  In CDPD, data is transmitted as packets in unused channels in the cellular telephone spectrum.  Because CDPD is packet based, it can tolerate increased latency and moderate data loss.  This allows the cellular network to give "best effort" delivery of data, knowing that if some data is lost, higher level network protocols will be able to retransmit or otherwise recover from the lost data.  
<p>
Ultimately by providing "best effort" delivery, CDPD should be able to provide higher bandwidth at a lower cost.  However most CDPD service coverage is concentrated in the major metropolitan areas.  There are efforts (especially in Japan and Finland) to significantly increase the performance of this type of access.  Once the bandwidth increases, this service may become a strong overall competitor to the cable, DSL, satellite, and fixed wireless solutions.
Because CDPD is tied to the cellular infrastructure, its deployment will tend to be in moderately dense population areas and along well-travelled highways.  But as the cellular telephone usage increases in general, more infrastructure capable of delivering CDPD services will be deployed. 
<p>
<h2>Broadband Considerations</h2>
<p>For many users, moving up to <i>broadband</i> speeds is almost like experiencing 
  a new Internet. Many households will choose a high-speed, or broadband, Internet 
  pipe if it is available to their home and if the price meets their budget. More 
  and more homes have this choice. In the United States, cable modem or Digital 
  Subcriber Line (DSL) are the primary broadband choices. As this book goes to 
  press, the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association estimates that 
  over 65 million households are within reach of cable modem service. Millions 
  more have access to competing Digital Subcriber Line (DSL) service from their 
  local telephone company. 
<p>As you appraise broadband alternatives, you will want to look at claimed service 
  speeds. First off, note that when we speak of data communications speeds, we 
  tend to talk in bits per second. When we think of data inside a computer, we 
  tend to talk in bytes per second. (For instance, 128 megabytes of RAM, or a 
  40 gigabyte hard drive.) There are 8 bits in a byte. Thus you should really 
  think of a 56 kilobits/second modem as roughly a 7 kilobytes/second modem. Note 
  that when Web browsers report download speeds, they use kilobytes/second as 
  well; mulitply the reported number by 8 to arrive at your actual download speed.
<p>Broadband has definite benefits. We recommend a broadband Internet connection 
  to all who can afford it. But in order for you to make an informed choice, it 
  is important to understand the inherent limitations of broadband services. 
<h3>Revealing Bottlenecks</h3>
<p>The difference in speed between dial-up modems or ISDN and cable modems will 
  astonish you. In fact, cable modems and DSL are so much faster than dial-up 
  that they tend to reveal <i>other</i> bottlenecks in your Internet experience: 
  latency, congested long-haul Internet links, slow servers at the remote end, 
  or even inadequacies of your own desktop PC. 
<h3>Latency and Congestion</h3>
<p>There are two factors you should be aware of as you evaluate Internet connection 
  choices. </p>
<p>Latency is a technical term whose meaning you should know about. Perhaps you've 
  heard the term used to refer to disk drives. In that context, latency is the 
  time it takes for your hard disk to position the read/write heads over the place 
  on the disk where the data is. The faster the disk rotates, the lower the inherent 
  latency for that drive, and the faster you get your data.</p>
<p>Latency also refers to the delays inherent in various data communications schemes. 
  A simple example is the time it takes for a radio signal to move from a satellite 
  to a ground station. For instance, the leading broadband Internet provider in 
  the United States, Hughes, uses a network of geosynchronous satellites orbiting 
  22,300 miles above the Earth's surface. If Internet traffic could be moved at 
  the speed of light, a round-trip to and from the satellite would theoretically 
  take just under a quarter of a second. But the real-world performance of Internet 
  protocols as implemented in software and hardware, plus the distance traveled, 
  add up to an inherent latency of about 1/2 second.</p>
<p>Half a second turns out to be a very long time for some applications. For instance, 
  if you are playing a real-time game with a friend and you both have satellite 
  Internet connections, you're going to find yourself very frustrated as you fire 
  your missile towards his spaceship which has long since left the quadrant. </p>
<p>Or, to look at it another way, let's say you start downloading a copy of Netscape 
  Navigator using a dial-up modem connection, and your friend starts downloading 
  the same 50 megabyte package over her satellite connection. You may see the 
  download begin before your friend does. But because your connection is 56 kilobits 
  per second, and your friend's is up to 400 megabits/second, you will still be 
  waiting an hour later, and your friend will be running the new release within 
  a few minutes.</p>
<p>Latency applies to any communications link that sits between you and the data 
  you want from a remote server. The local area network you will build in your 
  house will have a typical latency of less than 10 milliseconds -- that's 1/100 
  of a second. Depending on how many &quot;hops,&quot; or links you must traverse 
  between you and the remote server, there may be an inherent end-to-end latency 
  of a second or more. Fortunately, Internet protocols are well tuned to sending 
  large amounts of data efficiently.</p>
<p>The combination of latency and congestion are major factors in how fast an 
  Internet you experience. Think of an airplane trip from New York to Los Angeles. 
  You take the Long Island Railroad to JFK, board a flight on a 747, land in LA, 
  rent a car, and drive to Malibu. Each hop along the way adds some delay to the 
  experience. Maybe everything goes perfectly smoothly: the Long Island Railroad 
  train departs on time and runs at its rated speed; you check in at the airport 
  with no line, board the plane, and it departs on time. You fly to Los Angeles 
  at nearly the speed of sound. There's no line at the rental car counter so you 
  quickly hit the freeway and make a fast trip to the beach.</p>
<p>But the real world we know doesn't work that way. Crowded trains run slow. 
  Planes sit on the tarmac waiting to take off and circle before landing. There 
  are long lines at rental car counters, and LA freeways seldom move traffic at 
  the speed limit. All of these forms of congestion add up to the total round-trip 
  time you experience.</p>
<p>So it is with Internet traffic. Frequently it takes a dozen or more &quot;hops&quot; 
  between a remote server and your PC. Some delay is inherent based on the speed 
  of those hops. Other delay is introduced when various links are congested. Ultimately, 
  the quality of your Internet performance depends on the overall infrastructure 
  between you and the sites you visit.</p>
<h3>Other Delay Factors: Slow Servers and Your Own PC</h3>
<p>Most of us have experienced times when a Web page on a popular site took a 
  long time to download. Or maybe we saw a message while viewing a streaming video 
  that said &quot;Network congestion; rebuffering.&quot; It might be network congestion 
  -- or it might be an overloaded server at the remote end. Server capacity depends 
  on many factors, including the kind of computer, how fast its processor is, 
  how much memory it has, what software it is running, etc. When thousands of 
  users connect to an Internet server in a short interval, in many cases the server 
  can't keep up. The result is a slow Web page download or a broken streaming 
  video session.</p>
<p>Your own PC may play a huge role in your perception of your Internet experience. 
  It takes time for your computer to take in a Web page with large inline images 
  or a Java applet. If you are using an older computer as your Web terminal, it 
  may not be very efficient at pulling in content off the network, interpreting 
  it, and showing it to you on screen. A Pentium 100 computer with 16 megabytes 
  of RAM running Windows 95 is going to be a far slower Web terminal than a Pentium 
  4 running at 2 gigahertz with 256 megabytes of RAM.</p>
<p>You can often improve the Internet performance of an older computer by simply 
  adding memory to it. Current versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator 
  are memory hogs. If you have more than one browser window open the problem gets 
  worse. If you hear your disk drive crunching a lot as you surf the Web, consider 
  adding memory to your PC. If that's not practical, consider running Opera, a 
  lean and mean browser well suited to older PCs. </p>
<p>[Other notes on MTU tuning -- here or in an appendix?]</p>
<h3>Sharing Your Connection with More than One Home Computer</h3>
<p>Many broadband Internet providers offer service plans to support more than 
  one computer in your home. They may charge a premium for this option. Alternatively, 
  you may wish to acquire a piece of hardware sometimes called a &quot;Cable/DSL 
  Router&quot; to share your broadband pipe. With a cable/DSL router, only one 
  IP address from your home network is visible to the broadband ISP, while all 
  computers in your home can share the broadband pipe. You also can use software 
  solutions to share a single Internet connection, whether broadband or old-fashioned 
  dial-up modem. You should consider an in-home router or software sharing solution 
  before paying a monthly fee for extra addresses from your provider. Chapter 
  5 discusses these options in more detail.

  Internet.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
Your Internet connection choices range from the mundane to the exotic.  It would be nice if everything were simple and all these technologies were available to every consumer.  In the short run, you simply need to assess which technologies are avialable for your home and pick the best one for your needs.
<p> The "classic" choices are a standard telephone line, DSL connection, or a 
  cable modem. Fixed wireless and two-way satellite are a more exotic but very 
  intriguing solution. ISDN is a good choice if the cost is relatively low. One 
  way cable may be a good fit in some situations - it is a reasonable compromise 
  if the price is competitive - especially in rural areas. 
<p> A good place to research Internet service choices is the web site www.isp.com. 
  Another good source of information is to talk to your neighbors and others who 
  have tried the various services.
