<h1>Chapter 3: Home Internet Connection Choices</h1>
<p>Home networking is all about sharing resources. Sharing an Internet connection 
  among multiple home computers is a major reason people build their home networks 
  in the first place. This is especially true when a broadband Internet connection 
  such as cable modem or DSL serves the home, but Internet connection sharing 
  can be beneficial even if you are sharing an old-fashioned analog dial-up modem. 
<p>You will be pleasantly surprised by the performance you observe when sharing 
  a single Internet pipe among several home computers. Typically any single computer 
  connected to the Internet undergoes long periods in which it makes no use of 
  the Internet connection, with occasional bursts of increased usage. This pattern 
  of heavy use and idle periods means that four or five computers can effectively 
  share a single Internet connection, with all five users behaving as if they 
  have dedicated use of the connection. Of course, if Mandy is downloading MP3s 
  while Mom is downloading galleys of her next great American novel, the two users 
  will notice each other -- even perhaps if sharing a broadband pipe. 
<p>As you appraise broadband alternatives, you will want to look at claimed service 
  speeds. Be sure you understand the terminology, so that you make valid speed 
  comparisons. First off, be sure you've got your Greek numeric prefixes -- the 
  words we tent to put in front of &quot;bits&quot; and &quot;bytes&quot; -- memorized:
<ul>
  <li>kilo = 1000</li>
  <li>mega = 1,000,000</li>
  <li>giga = 1,000,000,000</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus you could think of a 768 kilobit/second DSL modem as a 0.768 megabit/second 
  DSL modem. When we refer to a 56K modem, we mean a 56 kilobit/second modem, 
  which could be thought of as a 0.056 megabit/second modem. 
<p>Note that when we speak of data communications speeds, we tend to talk in bits 
  per second. When we think of data inside a computer, we tend to talk in bytes 
  per second. (For instance, 128 megabytes of RAM, or a 40 gigabyte hard drive.) 
  There are 8 bits in a byte. Thus you should really think of a 56 kilo<b>bits</b>/second 
  modem as roughly a 7 kilo<b>bytes</b>/second modem. When Web browsers report 
  download speeds, they use kilobytes/second as well; multiply the reported number 
  by 8 to arrive at your actual download speed. 
<p>By putting speeds in common terms, you can compare theoretical performance 
  of different options. Let's assume you want to download a 50 megabyte file. 
  Such file sizes are not unreasonable; a full Netscape download is about that 
  size. Let's compare the time it would take to download at different speeds: 
  56 kilobits/second, the speed of an analog dial-up modem; 768 kilobits/second, 
  the typical ADSL speed; and 10 megabits/second, the speed of some advanced DSL 
  and cable modem offerings.

<p>Thus, our download would theoretically take about 15 hours using a dial-up 
  modem, just over an hour with typical ADSL services, and about 5 minutes with 
  advanced residential broadband. Read the end of this chapter to see why your 
  mileage may vary from these theoretical figures.
<p> Now let's explore the various connection options available for your home Internet 
  connection. Once you've made your choice and gotten your connection operational, 
  turn to Chapter 5 to learn how to share the connection among all the computers 
  in your home. 
<h2>Internet Pipes to the Home</h2>
<p> The Internet connection choices available to you vary based on where you live, 
  and what service providers have extended their service areas to cover your neighborhood. 
  Some choices are mainstream services available today; others are developing 
  options that may become practical in the future. The mainstream choices include:
<ul>
  <li>Analog modem over dial-up Telephone 
  <li>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 
  <li>Cable Modem 
  <li> Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) 
  <li>Satellite 
</ul>
<p>These mainstream choices are available to millions of current and potential 
  users. Not all of these are available in all areas yet, but the number of homes 
  potentially served grows each month. Also on the horizon are a number of alternative 
  Internet connection options in various stages of development, which could offer 
  competitive alternatives for connecting your home to the Internet. to the home 
  include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fixed wireless 
  <li>Optical wireless 
  <li>Electrical power grid 
  <li>Fiber optic cable (to the curb or to the home)<foot> </foot> 
</ul>
<p><foot>The alternatives to analog dial-up access aspire to offer high-speed, 
  or broadband, access to the Internet. &quot;Broadband&quot; means different 
  things in different contexts. The Federal Communications Commission defines 
  broadband as Internet service that carries data at speeds faster than 200 kilobits/second.</foot></p>
<p><foot>Most industry analysts agree that broadband alternatives will gradually 
  replace conventional dial-up, with residential broadband access exceeding use 
  of dial-up modems around 2005 or so. Analysts believe that by 2010 or so, 90% 
  of residences in the United States will enjoy broadband Internet access. These 
  analysts differ on the details of which technology will grow the fastest, but 
  most agree that cable modems and DSL will be the primary broadband choices, 
  each with perhaps 40% of the residential broadband market. Satellite is the 
  next broadband service of choice; fixed wireless, and other alternatives will 
  serve the rest of the market. Of course, technology developments and market 
  conditions could dramatically change the mix of broadband choices to the home. 
  Still, it seems clear that this decade will see the American home transition 
  from narrowband to broadband Internet access. </foot></p>
<p><foot>For both mainstream and developing choices, the basic goal is to deliver 
  broadband Internet services without having to rewire the world. Thus most of 
  these technologies seek to use existing wiring, such as your existing telephone 
  line or your existing cable TV cabling. Wireless technologies, by definition, 
  don't need to run new wiring. Power grid schemes would use the electrical wires 
  that run through your neighborhood and into every room of your home. </foot><foot>By 
  contrast, fiber optic cables to your curb or to the home would require the expense 
  of running new cables the &quot;last mile&quot; to your home. This option, once 
  thought to be too expensive to justify, is now being deployed in some cities.</foot></p>
<p><foot>This chapter will help you gain some understanding of these technologies 
  so that you can make the best choice among alternatives that are available to 
  you. Some readers may want to make a quick decision or may already have selected 
  their preferred pipeline. If you are in a hurry the following chart helps you 
  see the advantages and disadvantages of the available mainstream choices. If 
  there is a little telecommunications engineer inside of you waiting to get out, 
  you'll want to read the detailed descriptions of all of the mainstream and developing 
  options later in the chapter.</foot><foot></foot></p>

<p>Note that our discussion of features and prices applies to service in the United 
  States. However these same technologies are being offered by various providers 
  in many nations worldwide; the technologies and underlying concepts are similar. 
</p>
<p>Now let's explore each connection option in more detail. Then we will consider 
  some aspects of the nature of broadband into the home, and some thoughts on 
  choosing an Internet service provider.</p>
<h2>Home Internet Alternatives</h2>
<h3><foot></foot>Analog Dial-up Telephone Modem</h3>
<p>Even though millions of households have upgraded to broadband Internet service, 
  many areas are not yet served. And even in areas that have, for instance, cable 
  modem or DSL service, many customers may choose not to invest in the broadband 
  alternative. Thus, dial-up access to the Internet remains very widely used; 
  it is still the most common mode of connection to the Internet from homes. The 
  basic technology for a local dial-up telephone call has changed very little 
  over the decades; it is sometimes called &quot;Plain Old Telephone Service&quot; 
  or POTS.</p>
<p>As interactive computer terminals became popular in the Seventies, people wanted 
  to connect to remote mainframes without requiring a dedicated data link. The 
  dial-up telephone modem was the answer. People could dial into remote computers 
  from homes or remote offices using the same telephone service they already had 
  installed. A modem (short for &quot;modulator-demodulator&quot;) turns data 
  (0's and 1's) into sound, sends the sound through a telephone connection, and 
  converts the sound back to data at the far end. The birth of the PC two decades 
  ago was soon followed by the introduction of the venerable Hayes Smartmodem 
  and dial-up computing became a popular activity. Back then, people dialed from 
  homes into office modem pools or into dial-up Bulletin Board Systems (BBSes); 
  today, the home user typically dials into a local Internet Service Provider's 
  modem pool.</p>
<p>These days, most new computers on the market have built-in analog telephone 
  modems. For desktop computers the modem is typically an <i>internal modem -- 
  </i>a circuit card pre-installed in an expansion slot inside the PC. For laptop 
  computers, the modem may be built into the core circuitry of the PC, with a 
  standard RJ-11 telephone jack provided adjacent to other laptop ports. </p>
<p>If the PC you wish to use for dial-up access lacks a modem, you may choose 
  between internal modem, or you may opt for an external modem. Internal modems 
  are installed in a spare expansion slot inside the PC. External modems are standalone 
  devices with their own power supplies. External modems traditionally connect 
  to the PC over a standard serial (RS-232) cable. A more recent alternative is 
  a USB (universal serial bus) external modem, which connects to a USB port on 
  the PC. </p>
<p>External modems have some advantages. The indicator lights on the modem give 
  you more information about connection status and wheter data is flowing. It's 
  a lot easier to move an external modem from one computer to another. If something 
  goes wrong with the modem, you can replace it or send it for repair more conveniently.</p>
<p>But internal modems have advantages. They don't take up desk space. They require 
  no extra cabling; you plug the phone line into the PC. You don't need a separate 
  power cord. Internal modems perform slightly faster because they avoid the extra 
  overhead and latency inherent in moving your data over a serial cable into your 
  computer. People who play real-time interactive games may notice the difference, 
  but most mortals will not.</p>
<p>If you are adding a modem to an existing laptop computer, typically you will 
  buy and install a card modem in a spare PC Card slot. In the interest of portability, 
  external modems are seldom paired with laptops.</p>
<p> To better understand how the analog modems work, let's examine an early modem. 
<p> <b><font color="#FF0000">[Picture of an Early Modem (010)]</font></b> 
<p> Anyone who has ever used an analog telephone modem is familiar with the chirps 
  and warbles that are emitted as your calling modem places the call and then 
  negotiates a connection with the remote modem being called. Over the years there 
  have been a number of standards for modem connection speeds; most modern modems 
  can communicate with a wide range of older modems. (Today's modems follow an 
  international standard called V.90.) When a modem initially connects, if its 
  speaker is turned on, you hear a series of tones. The two modems attempt to 
  negotiate the highest-speeed connection they can manage, based on each modem's 
  capability and the condition of the telephone connection between them. It can 
  take nearly a minute until the sending modem "guesses" the right tone of an 
  older receiving modem. 
<p>Figure of POTS (020) 
<p> The connection speed you can achieve over a dial-up modem is subject to the 
  basic limitations of the medium. Telephones have limited fidelity when it comes 
  to the quality of sound that is transmitted from one phone to the other. Analog 
  telephone lines convey human voice at a level of quality that has not changed 
  much in 100 years of telephony; they are limited to a frequency range of 3000 
  Hz. Thus, modems operate under a fundamental limit of 2400 &quot;baud&quot; 
  (or 2400 signalling elements per second). Using sophisticated digital signal 
  processing, we can send up to 56,000 bits per second through this audio channel. 
  (Actually, Federal Communications Commission rules limit downlink speed on a 
  telephone modem to 53 kilobits/second.) Unfortunately, achieving this maximum 
  rate depends on a very clean telephone line and good connection. 
<p>Unfortunately, people living in older homes or neighborhoods, or people in 
  rural areas, may find that their telephone lines do not allow their analog modems 
  to connect at the highest rated speeds. Often in such cases your modem will 
  &quot;fall back&quot; to connecting at 28.8 or 33.6 kilobits/second. Analog 
  modems are slow enough; falling back to half speed is painful. The problem may 
  lie in your internal house wiring, or the wiring between your house and a telephone 
  pole, or the wiring back to the telephone company central office. Usually it's 
  not easy to convince the local telephone company to do anything about it; they 
  will tell you their job is to deliver reasonable voice service. Sometimes, if 
  you order a second phone line, the new wiring will behave better.
<p>In today's world of graphics-rich Web pages and multi-megabyte software downloads, 
  the analog modem is beginning to show its age. Many users who grow frustrated 
  with the &quot;World Wide Wait&quot; leap at the opportunity to move up to broadband 
  when it's offered to their home. Dial-up modems users also suffer with busy 
  signals when the Internet Service Provider's modem pool is fully occupied -- 
  and of course there is the long wait for dialing and negotiating every time 
  you want to use the Internet. 
<p> Even with these limitations, standard telephone modems are today by far the 
  most common way home users connect to the Internet. Many homes will share a 
  single telephone line for voice and Internet applications; others may choose 
  to invest in a second line, typically at a cost of about $20 per month including 
  taxes and fees. Dial-up Internet services that are not subsidized by advertising 
  typically run about $22 per month for unlimited usage. Thus the total cost of 
  Internet service for many dial-up users is about $42.00 per month. 
<p>When you dial into an ISP using a telephone modem, your Internet traffic is 
  carried using a special protocol called PPP, for &quot;Point to Point Protocol.&quot; 
  Traditionally Internet traffic us conveyed by TCP/IP. PPP provides a way to 
  package traditional TCP/IP traffic for a connection from one point -- your home 
  -- to another point -- your ISP. Support for TCP/IP and PPP has been built into 
  Windows since Windows 95, and the Macintosh since System 7.
<p>Some users who cannot abide the slowness of a 56K Internet connection take 
  advantage of a fairly recent innovation: &quot;modem doubling.&quot; Under modem 
  doubling, two POTS lines are used to connect to the ISP. Because two lines are 
  consumed both at home and at the ISP, you share the bandwidth of both phone 
  lines, allowing a theoretical throughput of over 100 kilobits/second. One approach 
  to this is &quot;modem bonding,&quot; which exploits two modems each using its 
  own phone line. Dedicated modems capable of modem bonding are smart enough to 
  use the two phone lines intelligently; if one line is used for a voice call, 
  the modem degrades to one-line mode gracefully, and resumes two-line use when 
  the voice call is completed. One manufacturer of such smart modems is Diamond, 
  which offers a &quot;Supra&quot; line of modem-doubling modems.. (Many ISPs 
  charge for use of the second line required for modem bonding; after all, you 
  are using two of their phone lines and modems, potentially tying up a line another 
  user needs.)
<p>If you do not have a modem with built-in modem-bonding capacity, you can still 
  achieve modem bonding through software. You will use two inexpensive modems 
  (either internal or external modems) each connected to its own telephone line. 
  An Internet standard called Multilink PPP (sometimes called &quot;MP&quot;) 
  defines the rules. All versions of Windows since Windows 98 support modem bonding 
  through Multilink. You can configure Windows Multilink to dial the second connection 
  when activity on your first connection exceeds a chosen percent of utilization; 
  you can also configure Multilink to hang up the second connection if activity 
  falls below a certain level. Macintosh users who wish to explore software modem 
  bonding may wish to consider a third-party product called LinkUPPP! Turbo. A 
  driver called &quot;Equalizer&quot; is available for Linux modem bonding.

<p>
<h3>ISDN</h3>
<p> Plain old telephone service (POTS) dates back to the origins of the telephone 
  at the beginning of the twentieth century. In the 1960's the telephone companies 
  in the United States and elsewhere began converting their long distance networks 
  to use digital transmission technologies, and began installing digital switches 
  in local central offices. But the telephone line that runs from the central 
  office to your house remained the familiar analog Plain Old Telephone Service. 
  ISDN was designed to migrate homes and offices from analog to digital services. 
  Thus the new service was called "Integrated Services Digital Network" or ISDN. 
  Instead of encoding data as analog sound signals, ISDN is digital. 
<p>The ISDN service offering typically used in home and small business applications 
  provides two 64 kilobit/second data channels and one 16 kilobit/second signaling, 
  or &quot;control,&quot; channel. This is known in ISDN parlance as a &quot;Basic 
  Rate Interface&quot; or &quot;BRI&quot; service. The 64 kilobit/second channels 
  are known as &quot;B&quot; channels and the signaling channel is called a &quot;D&quot; 
  channel; thus BRI service is sometimes called &quot;2B+D.&quot; The bottom line 
  is that BRI ISDN offers home users up to 128 kilobits/second of reliable data 
  capacity.
<p>The term &quot;ISDN&quot; also applies to service offerings seldom used for 
  homes. One service is called PRI or Primary Rate Interface. It offers 23 data 
  channels at 64 Kbps each, and one signaling channel at 16 Kbps. PRI service 
  usually costs far more per month than most households would be willing to pay. 
<p>Another term you may encounter is &quot;Broadband ISDN&quot; or B-ISDN. This 
  standard provides for integrating voice, data, video, Internet, and other content 
  over high-speed telephone links all the way into the home. Speeds of up to 1.5 
  megabits/second are envisioned. At 128 kilobits/second, basic ISDN does not 
  meet the FCC definition of a broadband service. At B-ISDN speeds you can begin 
  to think about moving full-frame video images over phone lines. Telephone companies 
  and others talk about B-ISDN a great deal, but it is not widely deployed. The 
  rest of our discussion assumes basic, or BRI, ISDN into the home.
<p> The ISDN connection essentially extends the functionality of the telephone 
  company's digital network into the home. Each of the data channels can either 
  carry a phone conversation or a data connection. To carry a phone conversation, 
  sound is digitized by special "packet telephones" which were to be installed 
  in the customer's homes. The designers of ISDN envisioned a wider range of digital 
  telephony gadgets. Unfortunately, that never really came to pass. Some people 
  claim that ISDN was priced too high; others feel that in 1980, we did not yet 
  possess enough technology to develop and manufacture packet telephones at a 
  reasonable price. Regardless of the reasons, ISDN was not readily available 
  until the mid-1990's. By then, the Internet revolution had occurred; data connections 
  had become "packet oriented" rather than "connection oriented."
<p> There are two basic ways to utilize an ISDN connection to the home:
<ul>
  <li>An <b>ISDN modem</b> operates much the same as a traditional analog dial-up 
    modem. Just as with analog modems, ISDN modems can be external (standalone 
    box with its own power supply that connects by an interface cable to the PC) 
    or internal (a card you install in a spare expansion slot inside the PC). 
    Versions of Windows since '98 have built-in support for ISDN modems. (We use 
    the term &quot;modem&quot; here somewhat loosely, because an ISDN line is 
    by definition already digital; your Internet data is not converted from digital 
    to analog. A more proper term might be &quot;DSU,&quot; or &quot;Data Service 
    Unit.&quot; But &quot;ISDN modem&quot; is used commonly, so we'll use the 
    term as well.)
  <li>The ISDN line can also be connected to an <b>ISDN router</b> which is stand-alone 
    unit. 3Com Corporation pioneered the concept of an easily-configured ISDN 
    router that could serve as a connection point for more than one home computer; 
    now a number of competitive products are on the market. A typical ISDN router 
    will have a connection for the ISDN phone line, two POTS connections, and 
    several Ethernet ports. 
</ul>
Most ISDN modems and ISDN routers provide connections to support standard telephone 
equipment. You plug your telephone into a conventional RJ-11 telephone jack. Then 
you use the telephone as if it were connected to a conventional POTS line. Each 
if the 64Kb connections is assigned its own telephone number. When you pick up 
an analog phone and dial a remote phone number, you hear the dial tone and the 
touch tones, but the telephone network never does. The ISDN modem or router actually 
generates the dial-tone that you hear in the handset. As you press keys, the router 
interprets the tones your phone generates, and translates your keystrokes into 
a digital call setup conveyed over the 16Kb control channel. When the connection 
is established, the router is notified on the control channel, and digitized sound 
begins to flow over one of the 64Kb channels. The ISDN router converts the sounds 
to and from digital form and acts as a bridge between the analog handset and the 
digital connection to the telephone company. When calling from an ISDN connected 
phone, you can dial <i>any</i> other phone on the global telephone network. If 
the destination phone is connected via a POTS connection, the phone company makes 
the necessary conversions between analog and digital.

<p>
When you have an ISDN modem or router in your home, many of the functions that were formerly done in the telephone company central office are actually done in your ISDN equipment. This allows significant flexibility in several ways.  
<p> When the ISDN router or ISDN modem is used for data, at least one of the 64Kb 
  connections is dialed to your Internet Service Provider (who also has an ISDN 
  connection). This connection is a direct digital connection which yields an 
  error-free 64Kbs. Generally, the PPP (Point-to-Point) protocol operates over 
  this connection. PPP handles both the initial authentication and the data transfer 
  over the link. 
<p>ISDN can be used in either an &quot;on-demand&quot; mode, or for a full-time 
  connection. Because it is digital, ISDN doesn't require the laborious negotiations 
  that analog modems require to set up a session. In fact, you can use an ISDN 
  link in on-demand mode and treat it virtually as if it were an &quot;always-on&quot; 
  full time connection; call setup normally takes just a few seconds. Users with 
  home office applications may wish to move up to a full-time connection. Your 
  ISP may charge a premium for this service. 
<p><img src="file:///D|/hng/book/03connection/056multilinkisdn3com.gif" width="400" height="234">
<p> Just as it is possible to exploit two analog modems over analog POTS service, 
  it's also possible to combine both 64K ISDN channels in order to achive a 128 
  Kilobits/second connection from your home to the Internet. You can use Multi-link 
  PPP just as you might use it for analog dial-up modems. 
<ul>
  <li>Using <b>ISDN Bonding</b>, when the connection is made, both lines are dialed 
    at the same time and "bonded" to form a 128Kb/sec connection. A simple way 
    to think of this is to imagine that every other bit is sent down the other 
    line, and the two bit streams are reassembled at the other end. The resulting 
    stream is 128Kb/sec through the modem connection.
  <li>With <b>Multi-Link PPP</b>, both connections are dialed separately. In theory, 
    they could even dial different ISPs, though this is quite rare in practice. 
    Multilink PPP is capable of dynamically adding the second channel when traffic 
    requirements demand, or removing the second channel as link activity declines. 
    Or, if you pick up a telephone connected to your ISDN modem, either to make 
    an outgoing call or to receive an incoming call, the second channel can graceful 
    switch to your voice use; the only impact is that during the voice call only 
    one channel is available to move Internet traffic. (As a matter of fact, you 
    could even dial a voice call and get a busy signal, and hang up the phone, 
    without ever affecting the data flowing on either 64Kb channel; your attempt 
    to place the call is carried over the 16Kb data channel.) When both channels 
    are available and you are moving lots of data, such as during a download of 
    a large file, you can achieve the full 128 kilobits/second implied by two 
    64 kilobits/second channels.
</ul>
:ISDN Bonding is typically used when ISDN is used for a full-time connection. 
In that case, you want both channels permanently dedicated to your Internet traffic. 
For the on-demand dial-up situation, Multilink PPP is more common. In any event, 
you will want to consider the service plans of potential ISPs before investing 
in ISDN equipment or deciding how you plan to configure your ISDN setup. 
<p> In summary, an ISDN connection into your home typically provides the following:
<ul>
<li>Two phone numbers which can be used with standard analog telephone equipment
<li>A data connection which operates at either 64Kb or 128KB/sec (typically based on traffic usage)
  <li>An Internet connection which connects in about 3 seconds (depending on your 
    ISP) so it feels like it is always on 
  <li>Multilink capabilities so that when you want to use the phone, your data
connection just slows down a little bit
</ul>
Some people order ISDN and use it as their only phone connection. This can be 
dangerous; if the ISDN router loses power, you cannot make telephone calls. During 
a power outage you might not be able to make a necessary call in case of emergency. 
So if you are considering an ISDN as your sole home telephone service, make sure 
to keep your router on an uninterruptible power supply that can operate the unit 
for several days. (Some people may feel a cell or PCS phone is an adequate backup, 
but these too can lose service in case of neighborhood power outages.) Another 
approach is to have one standard phone line and a second ISDN line. While this 
is somewhat costly, the end result is three phone numbers in your home. You have 
confidence of being able to use the POTS line in case of emergency, as it is powered 
at the telephone company central office with battery backup. 
<p> Unfortunately, ISDN often is not priced competitively when you consider the 
  amount of bandwidth you receive per dollar spent. Your phone company may charge 
  $40 to $50 per month for your ISDN line. In addition, your Internet Service 
  Provider may charge a premium to allow you to use ISDN; it is typical to pay 
  $30 or more to an ISP for unlimited ISDN service. Other ISPs may charge an hourly 
  rate for ISDN -- and double the fee if you use both 64K channels. This brings 
  the overall cost to use ISDN to nearly $80 per month. And some ISPs add bandwidth 
  metering on top of these fees! 
<p>You also need to consider one-time costs. Your telephone company may charge 
  a fee to install your ISDN line. Installation fees may apply to work at thecentral 
  office and on your own telephone line. Fees of $200 are typical. Your ISDN modem 
  will cost about $200 to $300.
<p>Given these prices for one-time setup and per month, ISDN is usually a poor 
  alternative to cable modem or DSL service when those alternatives are available 
  to you. Many commentators feel ISDN is a service that came too late and now 
  offers too little for the price. Nonetheless, in many rural areas or other broadband-deprived 
  locales, ISDN may be the best option to connect to the Internet at speeds faster 
  than a telephone modem. For some home users, ISDN is the right choice.

<p>
<h3>Cable Modems</h3>
<p> In the early 1990's, cable television companies began to experiment with high-speed 
  networking solutions that could use the existing cable TV wiring that extends 
  into millions of homes. The basic idea of a cable modem is to leverage the existing 
  cable that runs into your home. The very same cable can deliver Home Box Office 
  and 100 other channels as well as provide a high-speed, two-way Internet connection. 
  Cable modems accomplish this by using one or more channels of spectrum on the 
  cable to carry your Internet traffic. 
<p>A cable modem connection is &quot;always on.&quot; You do not endure the long 
  negotiations that dial-up modems must perform, or even the three second delay 
  of on-demand ISDN service. Your cable modem service fee includes your Iinternet 
  connection and back-end services such as e-mail boxes and access to Usenet News; 
  no fees are necessary for an additional ISP. Cable modem service closely resembles 
  having a connection that functions like a local area network connected via a 
  high-speed link. In fact, some customers operate small business servers over 
  their home-based cable modems. (Most cable companies charge more for service 
  plans that allow customers to operate servers over the cable plant. For reliability 
  and performance reasons, we suggest that small business operators generally 
  eschew running a Web server over a home cable modem connection.) 
<p> Cable modems make efficient use of existing broadband wiring into the home. 
  To make cable modems work, engineers had to overcome a number of challenges. 
  The first challenge is the fact that cable television distribution technology 
  was always designed to carry information in one direction: broadcast from an 
  origination point (called the "head-end") to subscribers' homes. In order to 
  keep from running thousands of individual cable connections from each house 
  to the head-end, the cable system is designed as a multi-level tree. 
<p> <img align=right src=file:///D|/hng/book/03connection/040cableoneway.gif alt="One-Way Cable Plant"> Between 
  the head-end and the subscriber, the signal is split several times. Each time 
  it is split, the signal is cleaned-up, adjusted and amplified. A cable company 
  needs to spend significant effort making sure that their amplifiers are properly 
  adjusted to insure that each subscriber had a high-quality signal. 
<p> In order to transform cable plants to support Internet traffic and other two-way 
  services, cable companies had to undertake significant upgrade projects. In 
  a two-way system, the amplifiers must take a subset of the channels coming <i>back</i> 
  from the subscriber's homes and pass that channel back up the tree. At a minimum, 
  this requires the replacement of all the amplifiers in the cable television 
  system. Furthermore, it is necessary to make sure that the cable system is very 
  carefully adjusted and monitored. A bad signal or badly tuned amplifier in a 
  one-way system may affect as few as ten homes. On the other hand, when there 
  is a bad signal in the uplink channel, it corrupts the channel as it is propagated 
  up the cable system. 
<p> Once the cable plant has been upgraded to allow one or more television channels 
  to be two-way, there is still the detail as to how we move network data across 
  television channels. At its most basic, a cable modem is indeed a "modem;" data 
  is converted from digital to analog before being transmitted over an analog 
  medium. Just as dial-up telephone modems allow digital traffic to be carried 
  over analog voice-grade phone lines, cable modems allow digital traffic to be 
  carried over analog broadband cable TV cables. In a way, the cable modem in 
  your home is a small television station. It is able to insert an analog signal 
  onto the cable on its assigned TV channel, and it is able to split off the analog 
  signal from an assigned channel and convert it to digital data for delivery 
  into your home.
<p>Besides handling the basic conversion from digital to analog and back, the 
  cable modem, we also must arbitrate among the different cable modems in your 
  neighborhood so that only one cable modem transmits at any given moment. You 
  and your neighbors share the same assigned TV channels for your cable Internet 
  traffic. If two cable modems transmit at the same time, their signals would 
  collide and no data would be transmitted. The collision might even produce noise 
  on other channels on the cable. Two cable modems transmitting at the same time 
  could conceivably cause your neighbor to see a bad signal while watching their 
  soccer game. 
<p> This arbitration is resolved using a protocol called "token bus". No station 
  is allowed to transmit until it has been told that it has permission - known 
  in industry vernacular as is the "token." If you have the token, you can transmit; 
  otherwise you must hold onto your data and remain silent. The network insures 
  that the token will be passed around in an equitable manner, so that even under 
  heavy load from several modems, each modem will have an opportunity to transmit 
  many times per second. 
<p> Cable modem technology may sound complicated. It is. But most of the Internet 
  technologies we rely on in our offices are also complicated, even though we 
  find them to be highly reliable. A well-built and well-maintained two-way cable 
  system with broadband Internet services can also provide extremely high reliability. 
<p> Cable modems provide a high speed, always-on Internet connection for prices 
  typically in the range of $30 and $50. There is no need for a second phone line, 
  and there are no ISP busy signals. If you consider the cost of an ISP and a 
  second phone line, a cable modem provides a much better experience at about 
  the same cost. 
<p>When first deployed, cable modems were proprietary, forcing you to rent a cable 
  modem from your cable provider. A standard called DOCSIS (&quot;Data Over Cable 
  Service Interface Specification&quot;) was introduced in 1998; it provides for 
  interoperable cable modems. Today you can buy a DOCSIS-compliant cable modem 
  at a retail computer store for about $200. You can keep the modem, and your 
  monthly cable fees will be lower, since you won't need to rent extra equipment 
  from the cable company.. Be sure your provider supports DOCSIS modems before 
  you buy. Look for the Cable Labs seal of approval on the box. (Tip: even if 
  you plan to buy your own cable modem, order your service with a rental modem. 
  After your installer has got the rental unit working in your home, you can swap 
  your purchased modem into a network that you know is functional.)
<h3>DSL - Digital Subscriber Line</h3>
<p>Like ISDN, Digital Subscriber Line technology comes from the telephone company. 
  Like ISDN, DSL's goal is to use existing telephone wiring to move data at speeds 
  far faster than analog modems can achieve. But DSL was born much later than 
  ISDN, and is far superior. DSL is designed to operate in a world that assumes 
  the Internet, demands high speed, and assumes that the data connection is always 
  on. </p>
<p>Like cable modems, DSL operates over wiring that is already connected to your 
  house. In the case of DSL, this wiring is the existing telephone connection. 
  With cable modems, you share bandwidth of one or more cable channels that have 
  been dedicated to carrying Internet data. With DSL, as with analog dial-up modems 
  or ISDN, you use the same phone line that is dedicated to your use all the way 
  from your home to the phone company central office.</p>
<p>The term DSL relates to a family of technologies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>ADSL, or asymmetric DSL, delivers data to your home at a higher speed than 
    the upstream link from your home. Typically ADSL offers a downstream speed 
    of 768 kilobits/second and upstream speed of 128 kilobits/second. (Technically 
    this does not meet the FCC definition of broadband, which assumes 200 kilobits/second 
    in both directions.) ADSL can run as fast as 7 megabits/second downstream 
    and 640 kilobits/second upstream. ADSL is the most DSL popular service offering 
    to homes.</li>
  <li>SDSL is symmetric; the downstream and upstream data rates are the same; 
    e.g. 768 kilobits per second each way.</li>
  <li>G.lite is an international standard for DSL appropriate for residential 
    customers, with downstream speeds of 1.54 megabits/second and upstream speeds 
    of 384 kilobits/second.</li>
  <li>VDSL, or Very-high-bit-rate DSL, provides downstream speeds of 27 to 52 
    megabits/second and upstream speeds up to 6 megabits/second.</li>
</ul>
<p> <img align=right src=file:///D|/hng/book/03connection/050phonecopper.gif alt="wiring to the central office"> 
  By using the telephone lines all the way back to the central office, the telephone 
  company can deploy new services to your home simply by changing the equipment 
  that your wires are plugged into (and changing how much you are billed each 
  month). Consider an example. Homes A and B have POTS, while C has ISDN, and 
  D has ADSL. Homes A and B use conventional analog telephone equipment available 
  at very low prices. Homes C and D need special equipment, which costs considerably 
  more, to make use of the advanced services of ISDN or DSL. 
<p>While having a direct connection from your home to the phone office is a seeming 
  advantage when deploying network services, making DSL work has taken a significant 
  amount of effort because of the limitations of a long, unshielded pair of copper 
  wires when used for data communications. The copper wiring installed in most 
  of the country to support POTS is a very simple kind of cable. An analog telephone 
  is a relatively undemanding devices - basically a microphone and a speaker. 
<p> If we move data across your copper telephone wires at higher speeds, the wires 
  become radio antennae. The signals begin to leak out of the wires. This has 
  two bad side effects. With too much leakage, a high frequency signal sent through 
  the wires does not come out the other end, because it has all leaked out. The 
  second problem is what happens when all this leakage occurs. Your leaked signal 
  ends up in nearby wires and devices, causing interference that can frustrate 
  you or upset your neighbors. These facts of signal transmission impose distance 
  and traffic limitations on DSL.
<p> The farther away your home is from the neighborhood telephone company central 
  office, the slower the maximum data rate you can achieve over DSL. If you are 
  too far from the central office, DSL simply won't be available to you. Thus 
  when you explore DSL services on a provider's Web site, you are quickly asked 
  for your precise street address. The provider has a very detailed national database 
  that knows how far each address resides from the central office that serves 
  it. Consider how distance affects possible DSL speeds: 
<p>&nbsp;
<table width="75%" border="1">
  <tr> 
    <td><b>Distance in feet</b></td>
    <td> 
      <p><b>Maximum Downstream Speed in Megabits/second</b>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>18000</td>
    <td>1.544 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>9000</td>
    <td>6.1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td>3000</td>
    <td>52</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> In the United States, residential DSL most commonly operates at 768 kilobits/second 
  downstream (into the home). This speed happens to be about one-half 1.54 Mbps. 
  ( A basic telephone service known as a &quot;T1 line&quot; operates at 1.54 
  Mbps; in 1985, this was considered a high-speed link for an entire business 
  or university.) The typical upstream speed is about 128 kilobits/second. Most 
  home users find that they download far more data than they upload. After all, 
  if you are surfing the Web, your upload traffic consists of URLs that are no 
  more than a couple of hundred characters each. The pages you download are usually 
  many thousands of bytes. However, it is worth noting that an upstream speed 
  of 128 kilobits/second does not meet the FCC definition of broadband. 
<p>It is not generally practical to get DSL if your phone line extends more than 
  18,000 feet to reach the central office. This limitation can be overcome with 
  amplifiers, or with recent advancements that move DSL interface equipment out 
  of the central office and into neighborhood cabinets that are closer to your 
  home. You won't be able to determine if you can get DSL by using your trip odometer 
  to measure the distance to your central office; you are at the mercy of the 
  phone company's database. </p>
<p> Even if your neighborhood has brand new wiring and is less than a mile from 
  the central office, not all central offices have the appropriate equipment installed 
  in the central office. As demand increases, DSL deployment in central offices 
  (and therefore the neighborhoods they serve) increases. Also, broadband providers 
  tend to respond to competition. When cable modems or other high speed Internet 
  alternatives appear in an area, DSL also tends to appear. 
<p> One of the slickest engineering achievements in DSL is the fact that a single 
  copper pair can both be used as POTS line <i>and</i> as an ADSL line at the 
  same time. This is done using different frequencies for the POTS signal and 
  the DSL signal. The POTS signal operates below 5Khz, where voice has always 
  been carried.. The DSL data is modulated, so that it starts well above the voice 
  signals. Both signals are combined onto the same wires. <font color="#FF0000">[Talk 
  about two pairs here?? -rww ]</font> In some cases, DSL may be carried over 
  theAt the receiving end, a simple analog filter (an inductor and a capacitor) 
  is used to separate the signals. In contrast to ISDN, there is no degradation 
  of data signals when you initiate or receive an analog voice call. 
<p> Another advantage of DSL over ISDN is the fact that DSL is &quot;always on.&quot; 
  DSL compares favorably with cable modems in this regard. When you want to surf 
  the Web or send e-mail, you do not have to worry about connection delays or 
  busy signals.
<p>In most locations, DSL services ranges from $40 to $60 depending of competition, 
  regulation, and the options that you choose. In most cases, your DSL service 
  cost includes back-end Internet services; your DSL provider becomes your ISP. 
  Thus your cost of DSL is inclusive; there is no need to pay an extra $20 per 
  month for a separate ISP. DSL can offer far faster service than ISDN at lower 
  prices and with the reliability of POTS in case of emergency. 
<p>In the United States, your DSL provider could be the local telephone company, 
  sometimes called a Baby Bell or your &quot;Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier.&quot; 
  A number of &quot;Competitive Local Exchange Carriers&quot; also compete for 
  your Internet connection dollars. The Web site DSLRreports.com is an excellent 
  resource for learning about DSL providers. The site allows you to enter your 
  own address and phone number, and see which Baby Bells and which other providers 
  compete to serve you.
<p>DSL can also be very cost-effective compared to cable modems. DSL prices tend 
  to be slightly more expensive at about $50 per month. Expect to pay about $200 
  for your DSL modem; this fee may be waived if you sign up for a one year contract. 
  Installation may cost $200 or so.
<p>One final point. Remember when we said that DSL uses your existing phone line? 
  We lied. In some cases, the phone company will use your existing phone line 
  all the way to the central office; often they will run a new, clean line to 
  ensure a good connection. In some cases, you can use the existing telephone 
  wiring within your home, and place your DSL modem in whatever room you wish, 
  plugging into an existing wall jack. But some DSL providers will insist on running 
  a new, separate DSL line inside your house to a new jack. You can still plug 
  a conventional telephone into the new DSL jack and use it without interfering 
  with your DSL service, but you lose the flexibility of moving the modem to any 
  phone jack in the house.
<p>When your DSL provider has to run a new line from the central office or install 
  a new line in the house, you see delay in getting your DSL in service. Normally 
  you will not have to be home for the rewiring of the line to the central office. 
  However you will have to be home for any in-house rewiring.
<p>
<h3>Satellite</h3>
<p> Satellite-based Internet connections for the home come in two forms: 
<ul>
  <li>One-way with &quot;telephone company return&quot;
  <li>Two-way satellite service
</ul>
<p>If you have a one-way satellite service, the data coming to your home -- the 
  &quot;downstream&quot; traffic -- comes in through the satellite dish at fairly 
  high speed. The data that you send to the network -- your &quot;upstream&quot; 
  traffic -- is carried over a conventional analog modem via your telephone line. 
  Such a configuration is sometimes called &quot;dialup return&quot; or &quot;telco 
  return.&quot; If your upstream traffic consists primarily of things you type 
  -- e-mail, instant messages, URLs in your Web browser -- then you may find this 
  configuration acceptable. On the other hand, if you regularly upload large files, 
  you will experience frustration, as you are limited to the speeds of any other 
  dial-up modem configuration.</p>
<p><img src="file:///D|/hng/book/03connection/085-direcpc1way.jpg" width="400" height="287"></p>
<p>Telco return also requires that you have an account with a dial-up Internet 
  Service Provider, and that you install specialized software on your PC to handle 
  the specialized routing of your Internet traffic. Support may not be available 
  for your type of computer; for instance, DirecPC and Starband satellite services 
  currently only work with Windows computers. You need a special &quot;dual-LNB&quot; 
  dish that's wider and taller than the 18&quot; dishes used for television-only 
  applications in North America. Given these complications and limitations, satellite 
  with telco return will probably appeal mostly to homes that lack access to cable 
  modem or DSL service.</p>
<p>Two-way satellite is now available as an alternative. Here, your satellite 
  dish is not only a passive receiver; it is also able to transmit back to the 
  satellite. The service costs more to install and more per month than the telco 
  return approach, while providing higher-speed uplink, &quot;always-on&quot; 
  service, and no need to tie up a phone line or have a separate dial-up ISP account. 
</p>
<p><img src="file:///D|/hng/book/03connection/090-direcpc2waytext.jpg" width="400" height="285"></p>
<p>Most satellite broadband subscribers choose to have a technician do the installation, 
  although it is possible for someone who is savvy with tools and technology to 
  do her own. For two-way satellite service, though, the FCC requires that a technician 
  perform the installation. Satellite providers warn that their services are intended 
  for residences that stay in one spot. Recreational vehicles are not supported.</p>
<p>Satellite Internet services can easily provide coverage in far-flung small 
  towns and rural areas that are not served by terrestrial competitors. All a 
  given subscriber needs is an unobstructed view of the southern sky.</p>
<p>Real time games don't work well over satellite links. The section on &quot;latency&quot; 
  later in this chapter explains why.</p>
<p>The main providers of satellite broadband Internet service in the United States 
  are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hughes Network Systems, with its DirecPC (telco return) and DirecWay (satellite) 
    products, which are sold to consumers by companies such as AOL, Earthlink, 
    and Juno. Satellite equipment costs about $500 and installation about $200, 
    with monthly service fees of about $70. The satellite modem plugs into a USB 
    port on the PC. Only Windows is supported.</li>
  <li> Starband service, developed by an Israeli company called Gilat. Starband 
    is marketed by the Dish Network and by Primus. Starband is a two-way service. 
    The company claims download speeds from 150 kilobits/second to 500 kilobits/second, 
    with upload speeds of 40-60 Kbps. Home interface equipment costs about $500; 
    installation is about $200, and monthly fees are about $70. The company gears 
    the service towards home users running Windows computers. Starband is able 
    to serve customers in Alaska who install a special receiving dish -- a real 
    boon for the broadband-deprived in the tundra. Normally the satellite modem 
    connects to a PC via a USB port. As of this writing, Microsoft and Radio Shack 
    also offer Starband service bundled with the purchase of a special Compaq 
    computer.</li>
</ul>
<p>With any Internet connection, your broadband performance will depend in part 
  on how busy your paths to the Internet are when you use the service. First generation, 
  one-way satellite broadband services shared the downstream path among large 
  geographic areas. Potentially hundreds or thousands of homes might share one 
  broadband pipe. For this reason, DirecPC and DirecWay impose a &quot;Fair Access 
  Policy;&quot; the satellite network knows how much bandwidth you are consuming, 
  and throttles your consumption down when you exceed certain thresholds, especially 
  at times of peak usage. The vendors argue that a small percentage of users will 
  consume precious bandwidth far out of proportion to their numbers without such 
  a policy.</p>
<p>Another approach to satellite broadband serves looms quite literally on the 
  horizon: Teledesic. Backed by the personal fortune of Bill Gates and other investors, 
  Teledesic promises to offer worldwide broadband service for Internet and other 
  traffic using low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites. Such satellites do not feature 
  the long latency of geosynchronous satellite communications. But the network 
  would require a much larger constellation of satellites; a low-orbit satellite 
  &quot;sees&quot; much less of the Earth's surface than one orbiting 22,300 miles 
  above the planet.</p>
<p> Those low-orbit satellites will require constant ground station monitoring. 
  Because the satellites are not in a fixed position relative to users, they will 
  have to &quot;hand off&quot; communications from one satellite to another in 
  the middle of a session. (Imagine if every cell phone user was stationary, and 
  the towers did all the moving.) Some observers believe the Teledesic plan faces 
  so many technical, operational, and capital hurdles that it will never be deployed. 
  While we wait, www.teledesic.com offers great visions of global universal broadband 
  from the sky.</p>
<h3>Fixed Wireless</h3>
<p> Wireless service is both a very old thing and a very new thing. Wireless has 
  been part of the telecommunications industry for decades. Today telephone companies 
  rely on fiber optic cable for metropolitan and long distance traffic, but microwave 
  still plays a role. Telecommunications giant MCI was originally Microwave Communications 
  Inc., using point-to-point microwave to serve industry. You probably have seen 
  microwave towers before. Unlike the now-common cellular telephone towers, a 
  microwave relay station has large dishes aimed towards other towers along the 
  horizon. With cellular phone service, one of the antennas -- the one on your 
  cell phone -- is mobile. With fixed wireless, all parties communicate using 
  stationary, or fixed, antennas. 
<p>Fixed wireless has also been used for high-speed Internet links for many years. 
  With fixed wireless, you do not have to obtain right-of-way and lay cable; nor 
  do you have to pay for service from the local phone company. All you need to 
  do is find a line-of-sight path between the points you want to connect, and 
  install specialized antennas and transmitting equipment. Schools, hospitals, 
  universities, governments, the military, and businesses have all built high-speed 
  data networks using fixed wireless. 
<p>Today a number of companies offer fixed wireless broadband Internet service. 
  Companies might be major telephone companies such as MCI or Sprint, or they 
  might be entrepreneurial companies who set up shop to serve a particular area 
  -- perhaps an area that is broadband-deprived. 
<p>In the United States a fixed wireless broadband provider chooses whether to 
  use unlicensed radio frequencies, or whether to bid for rights to their own 
  chunks of radio spectrum. The FCC has allocated unlicensed spectrum known as 
  the ISM (for &quot;Industrial, Scientific, and Medical&quot;) band for unlicensed 
  use, as well as the UNII (for 'Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure) 
  band. Any company can set up shop using unlicensed band providing they follow 
  rules, such as using spread-spectrum technology to minimize conflicts. In practice 
  only a handful of providers can share the unlicensed bands in a given community.
<p>In the last few years, the major telephone companies invested billions of dollars 
  on licensed radio spectrum. The chunks of spectrum licensed for residential 
  broadband use fall into two main categories:
<ul>
  <li>MMDS, or &quot;Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service.&quot; Originally 
    allocated as a wireless alternative to cable TV, MMDS can provide two-way 
    broadband from a single tower to homes up to 25 miles away.</li>
  <li>LMDS, or &quot;Local Multipoint Distribution System.&quot; Originally allocated 
    for military use, LMDS can now provide two-way broadband from a tower to homes 
    up to five miles away. Service may degrade when it is raining or foggy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixed wireless can follow a variety of transmission schemes. MMDS employs a 
  single tower reaching multiple homes; such a configuration is called &quot;point-to-multi-point.&quot; 
  Other schemes include &quot;Point-to-Point,&quot; where two stations communicate 
  only with each other using carefully aimed line-of-sight antennas. Some visionaries, 
  perhaps inspired by ham radio, imagine a world of &quot;point-to-consecutive-point&quot; 
  wireless networks, where homes and small businesses move data at high speeds 
  in a metropolitan fabric that avoids major telecommunications companies altogether. 
</p>
<p>Some people advocate use of the existing cellular and PCS networks for broadband 
  Internet service. Although these networks were built to serve mobile users, 
  there is no inherent reason why they cannot serve fixed locations such as residences. 
  Such service is called Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD). In CDPD, data is 
  transmitted as packets in unused channels in the cellular telephone spectrum. 
  Because CDPD is packet based, it can tolerate increased latency and moderate 
  data loss. This allows the cellular network to give "best effort" delivery of 
  data, knowing that if some data is lost, higher level network protocols will 
  be able to retransmit or otherwise recover from the lost data. Today, cellular 
  is not a viable alternative to the home; it offers dial-up speeds at higher 
  prices. Someday CDPD may be a viable broadband Internet option to the home -- 
  but not today.
<p>Major telecommunications companies have invested billions and talk a great 
  deal about fixed wireless. Sprint has deployed service in a few cities. AT&amp;T 
  claims to plan a &quot;wireless local loop&quot; service called Project Angel 
  using PCS spectrum. A national provider of wireless Internet service for fixed 
  and mobile users, Ricochet, went out of business in 2001. Overall fixed wireless 
  simply is not a mainstream alternative in most locales -- especially not for 
  residential use. Start-up companies serving small businesses in broadband-deprived 
  areas are, for now, the typical fixed wireless Internet providers. Up-front 
  antenna and equipment costs, as well as high monthly service fees, tend to be 
  out of range of household budgets.
<p>Ultimately, fixed wireless may be a viable broadband alternative for home use. 
  Wireless has the advantage that it has fewer legal barriers than DSL or cable 
  based solutions but it will be a challenge for it to scale in terms of bandwidth 
  in highly populated areas. Still, if you have access to fixed wireless in your 
  community, you should take a close look at it. 
<h3>Optical Wireless and Electric Power Grid</h3>
<p>Now let's consider the most speculative of developing broadband Internet services 
  for the home. A handful of companies tout &quot;optical wireless&quot; or &quot;free 
  space lasers&quot; or &quot;fiberless optics&quot; as an alternative to wired 
  and wireless radio solutions. Optical wireless would use light beams instead 
  of radio waves to carry data over a point-to-point connection mediated by lasers. 
  Optical wireless may hold theoretical promise but the technology has not been 
  deployed in real-world application. </p>
<p>Another speculative possibility for broadband to the home is the electric power 
  grid. Power companies not only run wires across the countryside and throughout 
  cities; those lines are connected to every room in your house. Those power lines 
  are extremely noisy; moving data reliably is problematic. But some companies 
  have built equipment that can demonstrate the possibilities. For instance, the 
  Swedish electric utility Vattenfall operates a demonstration Internet cafe on 
  the island of Gotland, using the Plus power line communication system from M@in.net. 
  Nonetheless, broadband Internet service over the electric power grid remains 
  a speculative option. (Use of the power lines <i>within </i>your home to carry 
  data, however, may be more viable; see Chapter 5.)</p>
<h3>Fiber to the Home</h3>
<p>Fiber optic cable is by far the best way to move data -- far superior to any 
  of the alternatives we've discussed for &quot;last mile&quot; service to your 
  home.. The data capacity of a single fiber optic cable is staggering -- thousands 
  of times more than a copper Ethernet cable. But fiber is expensive to install, 
  especially if we hope to install fiber as the &quot;last mile&quot; solution 
  for every household. That very reason is why alternatives such as DSL and cable 
  modems evolved. Fiber is widely used for long-haul and for metropolitan and 
  campus networks, but it has always been considered too expensive to lay fiber 
  to the home. But in recent years fiber costs have come down. Today's optical 
  data fiber is easier to work with, and the equipment that sends and receives 
  data over fiber is now much less expensive.
<p>Some visionaries believe that DSL and cable modems are interim solutions, and 
  that we should plan for running fiber all the way into the home -- and perhaps 
  even throughout the home. Thus we are now seriously considering &quot;fiber 
  to the home&quot; or FTTH. Fiber into the home would yield the ultimate form 
  of convergence, with high-definition television-on-demand, telephony, and Internet 
  traffic all carried over a single, very reliable, cable.
<p>Others propose an interim fiber solution, called fiber-to-the-curb, or FTTC. 
  A network access point would bridge from the curbside fiber to conventional 
  copper cables that serve the home.
<p>Although FTTH is not yet a mainstream broadband choice, a fiber-to-the-home 
  trial is under way in Palo Alto, California, and a private company is building 
  an FTTH network in Seattle. Fiber was once considered too expensive to fill 
  the need for broadband to the home. In a perfect world, we'd figure out a way 
  to string a fiber cable to every home in the land.
<h2>How To Choose?</h2>
<p>We've looked at so many home Internet connection alternatives that you may 
  wonder how you can make a choice. In reality, most households will only have 
  a few Internet connection types to choose among. But before you pick among various 
  options, your first question is: &quot;Am I willing to pay $40 or so per month 
  to move up to broadband Internet service?&quot;</p>
<p>For many users, moving up to broadband speeds is almost like experiencing a 
  new Internet. Many households will choose a high-speed, or broadband, Internet 
  pipe if it is available to their home and if the price meets their budget. More 
  and more homes have this choice. In the United States, cable modem or DSL are 
  the primary broadband choices. As this book goes to press, the National Cable 
  &amp; Telecommunications Association estimates that over 65 million households 
  are within reach of cable modem service. Millions more have access to DSL service. 
  Cable and DSL will be the main broadband Internet services to the home for the 
  next several years.</p>
<p>In areas not served by either cable modem or DSL, satellite may appeal. As 
  we've seen, up-front costs are higher; the monthly fee is higher; the service 
  is in some ways inferior. But satellite potentially reaches over 90% of the 
  homes in the United States. If you can't use broadband cable or DSL, you may 
  opt for satellite. </p>
<p>Other choices are more community-specific. Perhaps a fixed wireless provider 
  serves your area. Or perhaps you live in an urban apartment building that provides 
  high-speed Internet access in each apartment. Or you may choose ISDN -- or you 
  may choose to stick with analog dial-up while waiting for a better broadband 
  choice to arrive. </p>
<h3>Sharing Your Connection with More than One Home Computer</h3>
<p>Many broadband Internet providers offer service plans to support more than 
  one computer in your home. They may charge a premium for this option. For an 
  additional $5 or so per month per computer, they will support up to three or 
  four additional addresses. This can be a convenient way to acquire broadband 
  Internet for all the computers in your home.
<p>Alternatively, you may wish to acquire a piece of hardware sometimes called 
  a &quot;cable/DSL Router&quot; to share your broadband pipe. With a cable/DSL 
  router, only one IP address from your home network is visible to the broadband 
  ISP, yet all computers in your home can share the broadband pipe as if they 
  had their own Internet address. You also can use software solutions to share 
  a single Internet connection, whether broadband or old-fashioned dial-up modem. 
  You should consider an in-home router or software sharing solution before paying 
  a monthly fee for extra addresses from your provider. 
<p>Some broadband providers assume you want to connect your broadband pipe to 
  a single computer, not to a home with multiple computers. They may install proprietary 
  software -- or even a proprietary interface card inside a single PC. Proprietary 
  connections are an unnecessary hindrance to sharing your broadband pipe among 
  multiple home computers. You should avoid such a setup if you can. Instead, 
  you should seek a broadband service that connects using the standard TCP/IP 
  protocols built into your computer. We believe the best physical connection 
  is an Ethernet cable, which is the standard medium for local area networking. 
  Thus your ideal connection will be an Ethernet cable from your cable modem or 
  DSL modem (or other broadband interface) into an Ethernet port in your PC. Some 
  services insist on connecting to your computer using a USB cable, which may 
  be acceptable for software connection sharing, but will not work with standalone 
  cable/DSL routers.
<p>Chapter 5 gives more detail on sharing your broadband connection among multiple 
  computers.
<h3>Broadband ISP Selection Checklist</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Let's assume you've decided to move from a dial-up ISP service to a broadband 
  provider. This checklist will help you ask the right questions as you evaluate 
  broadband providers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is the initial equipment cost for service? Is there an option to buy 
    required equipment (such as the broadband modem) from an independent retailer? 
    Some providers will waive equipment costs if you sign up for a long-term contract.</li>
  <li>What does installation cost? Can customers do their own installation if 
    they wish?</li>
  <li>How much does service cost per month? If you rent the modem or other equipment, 
    how much is the monthly fee?</li>
  <li>How many computers in the home can you connect? What is the cost for each 
    additional PC?</li>
  <li>Are you given a static IP address or a dynamically-assigned address? (A 
    static address makes it easier to run a server in the home.)</li>
  <li>How is the broadband service physically connected to your computer? Do you 
    have to install proprietary software or interface cards within your PC? It 
    is far preferable to have a service that connects over an Ethernet or USB 
    cable and works with the standard TCP/IP software that comes with your operating 
    system. This will give you the most flexibility in using your service with 
    multiple computers in the home.</li>
  <li>What is the rated download speed of the service? What is the rated upload 
    speed? What does the provider say about speeds during times of peak load? 
    How does service degrade when others in your neighborhood are using lots of 
    bandwidth? </li>
  <li>Does the provider limit the amount of bandwidth you can use? If so, what 
    are the downstream or upstream limits? How do they enforce this?</li>
  <li>Does the provider allow you to run a server in your home; e.g. a Web server 
    or an FTP server?</li>
  <li>Does the provider offer full ISP services, including e-mail, access to Usenet 
    News, basic Web surfing, etc.? How many different user IDs or e-mail boxes 
    are provided? Usually cable modem and DSL providers bundle these services 
    with your broadband connection.</li>
  <li>Can you choose another ISP for such services if you wish to? Cable companies 
    such as AT&amp;T Broadband have stated their intention to allow customers 
    to choose alternative ISPs such as AOL or Earthlink.</li>
  <li>Does the provider offer dial-up service as a back-up when the broadband 
    connection is down?</li>
  <li>Does the provider offer dial-up service for times when you're on the road? 
    Is local modem service offered in cities throughout the U.S.? The world?</li>
  <li>Does the provider support Virtual Private Network (VPN) connections? If 
    you telecommute, you may use a VPN to connect securely to your company intranet. 
    Some ISPs explicitly do not support VPNs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to researching the broadband provider's service offerings, it's 
  a good idea to talk to neighbors who already have the service. They can give 
  you real-world insight into quality of customer service and performance during 
  peak times. Of course, treat these comments as anecdotal; just as your neighbor 
  may overrate the gas mileage on his Lexus RX-300, he may overstate his broadband 
  download speeds.</p>

<h2>Broadband Performance Considerations</h2>
<p>We recommend a broadband Internet connection for all households that can afford 
  it. But in order for you to make an informed choice, it is important to understand 
  the inherent limitations of broadband services. 
<p>You should take performance claims made by broadband competitors with a grain 
  of salt. Some broadband advertisements or news reports may lead you to believe 
  that you have more bandwidth than today's services can deliver. For instance, 
  although streaming media is far superior over today's residential broadband 
  services, you will not be viewing full-frame, full-motion high-definition television 
  over your DSL or cable modem. 
<p>Telephone companies like to claim that DSL is inherently superior to cable 
  modems because the latter shares bandwidth among all subscribers in a neighborhood. 
  Indeed, perhaps 30-50 homes physically share a neighborhood cable link. The 
  phone companies point out argue that your DSL line is yours alone, all the way 
  to the central office -- which is true. Crude analysis might lead you to believe 
  that only a handful of neighbors can share a cable line, but that conclusion 
  is wrong. Savvy network engineers will choose a faster shared medium over a 
  slower dedicated one. (Most cable modems operate at 1 to 10 megabits per second, 
  while most residential DSL service operates at 768 kilobits/second.) But usage 
  patterns vary; most of the time, some users are idle, and most of the time you 
  benefit from the faster shared bandwidth.
<p>Furthermore, the Internet is inherently a shared medium. While your DSL connection 
  is yours alone between your home and the central office, it is shared from that 
  point on within the phone company's Internet infrastructure, and on the global 
  Internet. Your actual experienced performance will depend on end-to-end link 
  speed and congestion throughout the entire Internet path. 
<p>A well-designed and managed cable plant can deliver service equal to or superior 
  to a competitive DSL service. The real issue is not the inherent differences 
  between DSL and cable. The real difference is which provider, the telephone 
  company or the cable company -- or another competitor -- has the technical staff 
  and corporate commitment to being a good ISP. Neither telephone companies nor 
  cable companies have an inherent advantage as ISPs; both kinds of companies 
  are relatively new to the ISP business. The best way to determine whether cable 
  modem, DSL, or some other alternative is best for you, is to talk to informed 
  consumers in your area. 
<p>You also should be wary of claims by broadband providers that their services 
  are &quot;50 times faster than a 56K modem.&quot; Let's explore why. The difference 
  in speed between a 56K modem and DSL or cable modem service will astonish you. 
  In fact, cable modems and DSL are so much faster than dial-up that they tend 
  to reveal <i>other</i> bottlenecks in your Internet experience. But you will 
  seldom sustain the rated speed of your broadband service due to several factors: 
  latency, congested long-haul Internet links, slow servers at the remote end, 
  or even inadequacies of your own desktop PC. 
<h3>Latency and Congestion</h3>
<p>As you consider broadband choices, it helps to be aware of the factors that 
  affect your Internet experience. One of these factors is called &quot;latency.&quot; 
  Perhaps you've heard the term used to refer to disk drives. In that context, 
  latency is the time it takes for your hard disk to position the read/write heads 
  over the place on the disk where the data is. The faster the disk rotates, the 
  lower the inherent latency for that drive, and the faster you get your data.</p>
<p>Latency also refers to the delays inherent in various data communications schemes. 
  A simple example is the time it takes for a radio signal to move from a satellite 
  to a ground station. For instance, the leading broadband Internet provider in 
  the United States, Hughes, uses a network of geosynchronous satellites orbiting 
  22,300 miles above the Earth's surface. If Internet traffic could be moved at 
  the speed of light, a round-trip to and from the satellite would theoretically 
  take just under a quarter of a second. But the real-world performance of Internet 
  protocols as implemented in software and hardware, plus the distance traveled, 
  add up to an inherent latency of about 1/2 second.</p>
<p>Half a second turns out to be a very long time for some applications. For instance, 
  if you are playing a real-time game with a friend and you both have satellite 
  Internet connections, you will experience a combined latency of one second. 
  You're going to find yourself very frustrated as you fire your missile towards 
  his spaceship, which has long since left the quadrant. The lag time imposed 
  by satellite communications is demonstrated whenever you see a U.S. television 
  personality interrupt someone communicating from England by satellite. Satellites 
  just aren't good for real-time interactive applications. In fact, because of 
  the extra delay inherent in communicating with geosynchronous satellites, the 
  vast majority of long distance telephone calls and long-haul Internet connections 
  are terrestrial.</p>
<p>Lag time means satellites are not good for real-time communications, but satellite 
  Internet service can still be a huge boon. Let's say you start downloading a 
  copy of Netscape Navigator using a dial-up modem connection, and your friend 
  starts downloading the same 50 megabyte package over her satellite connection. 
  You may see the download begin before your friend does. But because your connection 
  is 56 kilobits per second, and your friend's is up to 400 megabits/second, you 
  will still be waiting an hour later, and your friend will be running the new 
  release within a few minutes.</p>
<p>Latency applies to any communications link that sits between you and the data 
  you want from a remote server. The local area network you will build in your 
  house will have a typical latency of less than 10 milliseconds -- that's 1/100 
  of a second. Depending on how many &quot;hops,&quot; or links you must traverse 
  between you and the remote server, there may be an inherent end-to-end latency 
  of a second or more. Fortunately, Internet protocols are well tuned to sending 
  large amounts of data efficiently.</p>
<p>The combination of latency and congestion are major factors in how fast an 
  Internet you experience. Think of an airplane trip from New York to Los Angeles. 
  You take the Long Island Railroad to JFK, board a flight on a 747, land in LA, 
  rent a car, and drive to Malibu. Each hop along the way adds some delay to the 
  experience. Maybe everything goes perfectly smoothly: the Long Island Railroad 
  train departs on time and runs at its rated speed; you check in at the airport 
  with no line, board the plane, and it departs on time. You fly to Los Angeles 
  at nearly the speed of sound. There's no line at the rental car counter so you 
  quickly hit the freeway and make a fast trip to the beach. We move at various 
  speeds on our various &quot;hops&quot; from end to end, but we experience no 
  unexpected delays.</p>
<p>But the real world we know doesn't work that way. Crowded trains run slow. 
  Planes sit on the tarmac waiting to take off and circle before landing. There 
  are long lines at rental car counters, and LA freeways seldom move traffic at 
  the speed limit. All of these forms of congestion add up to the total trip time 
  you experience. Extra delays result in a trip much slower than the inherent 
  latency of a flight from New York to LA. Even if we flew the Concorde, cutting 
  the latency of the cross-country flight in half, we'd still spend hours on the 
  trip overall.</p>
<p>So it is with Internet traffic. Frequently your data follows dozen or more 
  &quot;hops&quot; between a remote server and your PC. Some delay is inherent 
  based on the speed of those hops. Other delay is introduced when various links 
  are congested. Ultimately, the quality of your Internet performance depends 
  on the overall infrastructure between you and the sites you visit.</p>
<h3>Other Delay Factors: Slow Servers -- and Your Own PC</h3>
<p>Most of us have experienced times when a Web page on a popular site took a 
  long time to download. Or maybe we saw a message while viewing a streaming video 
  that said &quot;Network congestion; rebuffering.&quot; It might be network congestion 
  -- or it might be an overloaded server at the remote end. Server capacity depends 
  on many factors, including the kind of computer, how fast its processor is, 
  how much memory it has, what software it is running, etc. When thousands of 
  users connect to an Internet server in a short interval, in many cases the server 
  can't keep up. The result is a slow Web page download or a broken streaming 
  video session.</p>
<p>Your own computer's performance plays a huge role in your perception of your 
  Internet experience. It takes time for your computer to take in a Web page with 
  large inline images or a Java applet. If you are using an older computer as 
  your Web terminal, it may not be very efficient at pulling in content off the 
  network, interpreting it, and showing it to you on screen. A Pentium 100 computer 
  with 16 megabytes of RAM running Windows 95 is going to be a far slower Web 
  terminal than a Pentium 4 running Windows 2000 at 2 gigahertz with 256 megabytes 
  of RAM.</p>
<p>You can often improve the Internet performance of an older computer by simply 
  adding memory to it. Current versions of Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator 
  are memory hogs. If you have more than one browser window open the problem gets 
  worse. If you hear your disk drive crunching a lot as you surf the Web, consider 
  adding memory to your PC. If that's not practical, consider running Opera, a 
  lean and mean browser well suited to older PCs. </p>
