<H3>Home Internet Choices</H3>
<P>Sharing an Internet connection is one of the main motivations of building a 
home network. Typically when a single computer is connected to the Internet, 
there are long periods while the connection is idle. This pattern of heavy use 
and idle periods means that four or five computers can use a single Internet 
connection and all five computers seem to have sole use of the connection. But 
before we show how to share an internet connection we first will review the 
myriad of connection options available for your home Internet connection. 
<P>Generally, which choice you have will depend on where you live. The list of 
available options includes: 
<UL>
  <LI>Analog Telephone Modem 
  <LI>ISDN Networking 
  <LI>Cable Modem 
  <LI>DSL - Digital Subscriber Loop 
  <LI>Fixed Wireless 
  <LI>Satellite 
  <LI>Cellular phone based services </LI></UL>Each of these choices gives you a 
different price and performance value. If you are lucky and have a choice of 
different technologies, this chapter will help you gain some understanding of 
these technologies so that you can make the best choice. 
<P><FOOT>If you are in a hurry, and just want to know which service to choose, 
feel free to skip to the conclusion of this chapter, we won't be offended. But 
if there is a little telecommunications engineer inside of you waiting to get 
out, read on. </FOOT>
<P>
<H3>Analog Modem</H3>In the beginnings of home networking in the 1970's there 
were no data connections into the home. So the solution was to find a way that 
telephones could be used to transfer data. The solution to this problem is a 
Modem (short for modulator-demodulator). The idea was to turn data (0's and 1's) 
into sound, send the sound through a telephone connection and convert the sound 
back to data at the far end. 
<P>To better understand how the analog modems work, we can examine an early 
modem. 
<P>Picture of an Early Modem (010) 
<P>When a modem initial connects and the speaker is turned on, you hear a series 
of tones. These tones are used so that the calling modems can determine the type 
of of the receiving modem. Each tone is sent for a few seconds and the receiving 
modem responds to its particular tone and a connection is established. Most 
modern modems can communicate with a wide range of older modems. It can take 
nearly a minute until the sending modem "guesses" the right tone of an older 
receiving modem. 
<P>This works well, but telephones have limited fidelity when it comes to the 
quality of sound which is transmitted from one phone to the other. Because 
phones are intended to portray human voice, they are limited to a frequency 
range of 3000 Hz. This is why modems are limited to 2400 baud. Using 
sophisticated digital signal processing, we can send up to 56000 bits per second 
through this audio channel. Unfortunately, achieving this maximum rate depends 
on a very clean telephone line and good connection. 
<P>Figure of POTS (020) 
<P>Even with these limitations, standard telephone modems are by far the most 
common Internet connection from homes. The nominal cost for a phone line is 
$16.00 and the cost of Internet service is about $20.00 for a total cost of 
$36.00 per month. 
<P>
<H3>ISDN</H3>
<P>Plain old telephone service (POTS) dates back to the origins of the telephone 
at the beginning of the twentieth century. In the 1970's (Rich check this one), 
the telephone companies began to design the new "telephone service" to replace 
plain old telephone service. This new service was called "Integrated Services 
Digital Network" or ISDN. Instead of sending sound, ISDN deals with data. The 
basic ISDN service provided two 64kbit data channels and one 16kbit signaling 
channel. Each of the data channels could carry a digitized phone conversation. 
<P>The ISDN connection essentially extended the functionality of the telephone 
company switching equipment into the home. Each of the data channels can either 
carry a phone conversation or a data connection. To carry a phone conversation, 
the sound was digitized by special "packet telephones" which were to be 
installed in the customer's homes. The architecture of ISDN envisioned a wider 
range of digital telephony "gadgets" - but unfortunately, that never really came 
to pass. Some people would claim that ISDN was priced too high while others 
might feel that in 1980, we did not yet possess enough technology to develop and 
manufacture packet telephones at a reasonable price. Regardless of the reasons, 
ISDN was not readily available until the mid-1990's and by then, the Internet 
revolution had occurred when data connections were "packet oriented" rather than 
"connection oriented". 
<P>In many locations, because of limitations of ADSL or Cable Modems, ISDN is 
the only option to go faster than a telephone modem without resorting to 
wireless. Even thought ISDN is somewhat past the peak of its technology curve, 
there are two basic solutions to use ISDN in a home network. 
<UL>
  <LI>An <B>ISDN modem</B> communicates with the computer throught a serial port 
  or as a built-in card - in this case, the ISDN modem operates much the same as 
  a normal modem. Windows-98 has built-in support for ISDN modems. 
  <LI>The ISDN line can also be connected to an <B>ISDN router</B> which is 
  stand-alone unit. A typical ISDN router will have a connection for the ISDN 
  phone line, two POTS connections, and several Ethernet ports. </LI></UL>Most 
ISDN modems and ISDN routers have connections to support standard telephone 
equipment. Each if the 64Kb connections is assigned a telephone number - by 
plugging in a standard telephone equipment. 
<P>When you pick up an analog phone and dial another phone, the ISDN modem or 
router actually is generating the dial-tone that you hear in the handset. As you 
press keys, the router interprets the tones and once you have dialed the phone 
number it requests a connection over the 16Kb control channel. When the 
connection is established, the router is notified on the control channel and 
digitized sound begins to flow over one of the 64Kb channels. The ISDN router 
converts the sounds to and from digital form and acts as a bridge between the 
analog handset and the digital connection to the telephone company. When calling 
from an ISDN connected phone, you can dial <I>any</I> other phone. If the 
destination phone is connected via a POTS connection, the phone company makes 
the necessary conversions between analog and digital. 
<P>Picture of the ISDN router and analog phone 
<P>When you have an ISDN modem or router in your home, many of the functions 
that were formerly done in the telephone company central office are actually 
done in your ISDN equipment. This allows significant flexibility in several 
ways. 
<P>When the ISDN router or ISDN modem is used for data, at least one of the 64Kb 
connections is dialed to your Internet Service Provider (who also has an ISDN 
connection). This connection is a direct digital connection which yeilds an 
error-free 64Kbs. Generally, the PPP (Point-to-Point) protocols operates over 
this connection. PPP handes both the initial authentication and the data 
transfer over the link. 
<P>There are two ways to get up to 128Kb/sec on your Internet connection. 
<UL>
  <LI>Using <B>Bonding</B>, when the connection is made, both lines are dialed 
  at the same time and "bonded" to form a 128Kb/sec connection. A simple way to 
  thing of this is to imaging that every other bit is sent down the other 
  conection and then the bits are re-interleaved at the other end. The resulting 
  stream is 128Kb/sec through the modem 
  <LI>With <B>Multi-Link PPP</B>, both connections are dialed separately (they 
  can even dial different ISPs) and as data packets arrive, one is sent down one 
  channel and the next is sent down the other channel. During busy use, like 
  during a file transfer this also will yield 128Kb/sec. </LI></UL>While bonding 
might seem like the ideal aproach, it is used less often than multi-link PPP for 
the following reasons: 
<UL>
  <LI>Internet service providers prefer that you only make the second connection 
  when your traffic exceds a predetermined threshold and then drop the second 
  connection when your traffic drops. This way they do not have to have two 
  lines for every single customer. So some ISPs simply do not allow bonding. 
  <LI>With Multi-Link PPP, the second connection can be dropped if needed. This 
  happens when you pick up an analog phone connected to the router and make a 
  call or when there is an incoming call. This works quite nicely because the 
  ISDN equipment can communicate with the phone company using the 16Kb channel 
  without disturbing the data being transferred over the two 64Kb connections. 
  As a matter of fact, you could dial a call and get a busy signal, and hang up 
  the phone without ever affecting the data flowing on a 64Kb channel. 
</LI></UL>Bonding is typically used when ISDN is used for a full-time 
connection, rather than an on-demand dial-up situation. 
<P>With one ISDN connection into your home, you get the following: 
<UL>
  <LI>Two phone numbers which can be used with standard analog telephone 
  equipment 
  <LI>A data connection which operates at either 64Kb or 128KB/sec (typically 
  based on traffic usage) 
  <LI>An internet connection which connects in about 3 seconds (depending on 
  your ISP) so it feels like it is always on 
  <LI>Multilink capabilities so that when you want to use the phone, your data 
  connection just slows down a little bit </LI></UL>Some people order ISDN and use 
it as their only phone connection. The only limitation to this approach is that 
when the ISDN router loses power, you cannot make analog telephone calls. So if 
you are considering an ISDN as your sole connection to the phone company make 
sure to keep it on an uninterruptable power supply which can operate the unit 
for several days. Another approach is to have one standard phone line and a 
second ISDN line. While this is somewhat costly, you end up with three phone 
numbers in your home and the POTS line is powered by the phone company. 
<P>One of the primary downsides of using ISDN is the cost. An ISDN line may cost 
about $50 per month (they are more expensive than POTS). In addition, your 
Internet Service Provider may charge a premium to allow you to use ISDN - it is 
typical to pay $30 or more to an ISP for unlimited ISDN service. This takes the 
overall cost to use ISDN to nearly $80.00 per month. 
<P><B>TODO: SPIDS and Ordering and Synchronous (always transmistting zeros)</B> 
<P>
<H3>Cable Modem</H3>
<P>In the mid 1990's, cable television companies began to experiment with and 
deploy networking solutions based on the CATV connections into many urban and 
suburban homes. Unlike POTS and ISDN, cable modems were developed from the 
ground up to do packet-oriented data networking. The basic idea was to dedicate 
one or more television channels to data networking. 
<P>A cable modem connection is permanently on - the service includes your 
internet connection, so no fees are necessary for the ISP. Often you can 
purchase a service which wil allow you to have a web or file server permanently 
connected to the net in your home. It is the closest thing to having a 
connection which functions like a local area network which is connected via a 
high-speed link. 
<P>While this seems simple and clever, there are a number of challenges which 
must be faced to use CATV for data networking. The first challenge is the fact 
that cable television distribution had always been designed to be a broadcast 
from an origination point (called the "head-end") to the subscribers. In order 
to keep from running thosands of individual cable connections from each house to 
the head-end, the cable system is designed as a multi-level tree. 
<P><IMG align=right alt="One-Way Cable Plant" 
src="index_files/040cableoneway.gif"> Between the head-end and the subscriber, 
the signal is split several times. Each time it is split, the signal is 
cleaned-up, adjusted and amplified. A cable company needed to spend signiifcant 
effort making sure that their amplifiers were properly adjusted to insure that 
each subscriber had a high-quality signal. 
<P>While this seems complex enough, using this structure to implement two-way 
high-speed data communications is very challenging. The first task is to convert 
the cable plant to be a two-way system. In a two-way system, the amplifiers must 
take a subset of the channels coming <I>back</I> from the subscriber's homes and 
pass that channel back up the tree. At a minimum, this requires the replacement 
of all the amplifiers in the cable television system. Furthermore, it is 
necessary to make sure that the cable system is very carefully adjusted and 
monitored. A bad signal or badly tuned amplifier in a one-way system may affect 
as few as ten homes. On the other hand, when there is a bad signal in the uplink 
channel, it corrupts the channel as it is propogated up the cable system. 
<P>Once the cable plant has been upgraded to allow one or more television 
channels to be two-way, there is still the detail as to how we move network data 
across television channels. At its most basic, a cable modem is indeed a "modem" 
- that is that the data is converted from digital to analog (in this case video 
rather than audio) before being transmitted over an analog medium. In a way, the 
cable modem in your home is a small "television station". Once the basic 
conversion from digital to analog has handles, we also must arbitrate between 
the different cable modems so that only one cable modem transmits at any given 
moment. If two cable modems transmit at the same time, their signals would 
collide and no data would be transmitted. The collision might even produce noise 
on other channels on the cable - so two cable modems transmitting at the same 
time could cause your neighbor to see a bad signal while watching their soccer 
game. 
<P>This arbitration is resolved using a protocol called "token bus". No station 
is allowed to transmit until it has been told that it has permission - the 
permission is the "token" - if you have the token, you can transmit, otherwise 
you must hold onto your data and remain silent. The network insures that the 
token will be fairly passed around, so that even under heavy load from several 
modems, each modem will have an opportunity to transmit many times per second. 
<P>All this technical detail, is not meant to scare you from using cable modems 
- a well-built and well-maintained two-way cable system provides extremely high 
reliability. But the idea is to give you some idea as to the significant 
engineering which goes making a cable modem work. And perhaps when the technical 
support person from the cable company fixes your connection, you can tell them 
an extra-special special "thank you". 
<P>You should feel fortunate if cable modems are in your area. They provide high 
speed, always-on service for somewhere between $30 and $50. If you consider the 
cost of an ISP and a second phone line, a cable modem provides a much better 
experience at about the same cost. 
<P>
<H3>ADSL - Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Loop </H3>ADSL is a telephone company 
technology - it was designed much more recently than ISDN and designed to 
operate in a world which assumes the Internet, demands high speed, and assumes 
that the data connection is always on. Like cable modems, ADSL was designed to 
operate on wiring which is already connected to your house. In the case of ADSL, 
this wiring is the existing telephone connection. Unlike the cable system, your 
telephone connection is a dedicated pair of copper wires which run from your 
home back to the telephone company - these wires terminate in a building called 
the "central office". 
<P><IMG align=right alt="wiring to the central office" 
src="index_files/050phonecopper.gif"> By running all of the wires all the way 
back to the central office, the telephone company can deploy new services to 
your home simply by changing the equipment which your wires are plugged into 
(and changing how much you are billed each month). In the above example, homes A 
and B have POTS, while C has ISDN, and D has ADSL. Of course, C and D need 
special equipment to make use of their advanced services. 
<P>While having a direct connection from your home to the phone office is a 
seeming advantage when deploying network services, making ADSL work has taken a 
significant amount of effort because of the limitations of a long, unshielded 
pair of copper wires when used for data communications. The copper wiring 
installed in most of the country to support POTS is effectively long speaker 
wire. An analog telephone is basically a microphone and a speaker. 
<P>As we move data across these copper wires, as the speeds increase, the wires 
become radio antennae. The signals begin to "leak out" of the wires - this has 
two bad side effects - with too much leakage, a high frequency signal which is 
sent through the wires does not come out the other end because it has all leaked 
out. The second problem is where all this leakage goes after it leaks out of the 
wires. It end up in all of the other nearby wires causing interference. 
<P>The speed at which data can be transmitted using telephone-style copper pairs 
of wires depends on two factors: (1) the quality of the wiring and (2) the 
length of the wires. As such ADSL is not available in every single home in an 
area - and the farther away from the central office one gets, the slower the 
maximum data rate that you will get. That is why you must provide your precise 
street address when ordering ADSL - they are computing the distance and looking 
up how your home is wired to the central office. 
<P><PRE>Distance (feet)     Maximum Speed (upstream+downstream)
18000                1.544 Mbps
9000                 6.1 Mbps
</PRE>Generally, to be conservative, most ADSL installations will operate at 
768Kbps (about 1/2 of 1.54 Mbps) downstream and somewhere between 128-384Kbps 
upstream. It is not generally practical to get ADSL if you are farther than 
18000 feet from the central office without adding apmplifiers. And it is 
difficult to add the amplifiers because they must be installed in a way that no 
segment is greater than 18000 feet. 
<P>Even if your neighborhood has brand new wiring and is less than a mile from 
the central office, not all central offices have the apropriate equipment 
installed in the central office. But hopefully over time (much like ISDN) as 
demand (and revenue) for ADSL increases, it will be more widely available. 
<P>One of the slickest engineering achievements in ADSL is the fact that a 
single copper pair can both be used as POTS line <I>and</I> as an ADSL line at 
the same time. This is done using different frequencies for the POTS signal and 
the ADSL signal. The POTS signal is sound and operates at below 5Khz. The ADSL 
data is modulated so that it starts well above the voice signals. Both signals 
are combined onto the wire and at the receiving end, a simple analog filter (an 
inductor and a capacitor) is used to separate the signals. 
<P>Another advantage of ADSL over ISDN is the fact that ADSL is always on - 
because ADSL is oriented towards Internet-style traffic and not continuous 
synchronous data (like ISDN), if you are not sending or receiving any data using 
ADSL, no data is being forwarded. In a sense, this makes ADSL, less resource 
intensive for the phone company than ISDN. In most cases, your ADSL service 
includes the Internet connectivity, so there is no need to pay an extra $20 per 
month for Internet service. 
<P>In most locations, ADSL services ranges from $30 to $60 depending of 
competition and the options that you choose. 
<P>
<H3>Fixed Wireless</H3>
<P>Fixed high speed wireless solutions are available is a small number of 
communities. These services typically are using the 2.4Ghz or 5.4Ghz 
frequencies. These frequencies are unlicensed, but equipment operating in these 
frequencies must follow certain power rules and tolerate interference from other 
equipment operating in the same frequency. These solutions can provide from 0.5 
- 20Mb/sec connectivity at a cost comparable to DSL or cable modem. 
<P>It will take some time to see if fixed wireless expands beyond its core 
markets of: 
<UL>
  <LI>Suburban areas with a high density of hi-tech workers 
  <LI>Rural areas with moderate population density which are not suitable for 
  Cable Television. </LI></UL>Ultimately, fixed wireless may be viable as a 
long-term direct competitor to cable modem and DSL. Wireless has the advantage 
that it has fewer legal barriers than DSL or cable based solutions but it will 
be a challenge for it to scale in terms of bandwidth in highly populated areas. 
If you have access to fixed wireless in your community, you should take a close 
look at it. 
<P>
<H3>Satellite</H3>
<P>Satellite based services come in two forms: 
<UL>
  <LI>One-way with telephone company return 
  <LI>Two-way satellite service </LI></UL>With the first option, the data coming 
to your home comes in through the satellite dish at high speed. The data that 
you send to the network si carried over a telephone or other land-based 
technology. This solution improves performance on web surfing and downloads, but 
does not allow you to have any type of server in your home and does not improve 
the performance of any type of upload of information. 
<P>The two-way satellite based services are problemtic but coming up on the 
horizon. These services have extremely large up-front costs (see how much the 
last rocket lanugh sold for on ebay!). Once two-way satelite is well-deployed, 
they will be a true competitor for DSL and cable modems if they can be cost 
effectively deployed. These systems have the potential for nearly universal 
geographic coverage and should be a boon to rural environments. 
<P>
<H3>Cellular Services</H3>Cellular services fall into two basic categoories: 
<UL>
  <LI>Analog-style connection oriented access 
  <LI>CDPD - Cellular Digital Packet Data </LI></UL>It has been possible to use a 
cellular telephone to make a "call" and transfer data similar to an analog 
modem. Initially this was limited to 2400bps, but with improving technology and 
digital phones, the speeds are approaching 56kbps. The cost of using this type 
of service is usually based on the minutes of used charged at the cellular rate 
in your cellular plan. There may be a monthly charge to allow data services in 
some pricing plans. This approach has very complete coverage, but it is not 
really practical when compared to a standard telephone line for home use. 
<P>A more exciting cellular technology is Cellular Digital Packet Data (CDPD). 
In CDPD, data is transmitted as packets in unused channels in the cellular 
telephone spectrum. Because CDPD is packet based, it can tolerate increased 
latency and moderate data loss. This allows the cellular network to give "best 
effort" delivery of data, knowing that if some data is lost, higher level 
network protocols will be able to retransmit or otherwise recover from the lost 
data. 
<P>Ultimately by providing "best effort" delivery, CDPD should be able to 
provide higher bandwidth at a lower cost. However most CDPD service coverage is 
concentrated in the major metropolitan areas. There are efforts (especially in 
Japan and Finland) to significantly increase the performance of this type of 
access. Once the bandwidth increases, this service may become a strong overall 
competitor to the cable, DSL, satellite, and fixed wireless solutions. Because 
CDPD is tied to the cellular infrastructure, its deployment will tend to be in 
moderately dense population areas and along well-travelled highways. But as the 
cellular telephone usage increases in general, more infrastructure capable of 
delivering CDPD services will be deployed. 
<P>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>Your Internet connection choices range from the mundane to the exotic. It 
would be nice if everything were simple and all these technologies were 
available to every consumer. In the short run, you simply need to assess which 
technologies are avialable for your home and pick the best one for your needs. 
<P>The "classic" choices are a standard telephone line, DSL connection, or a 
cable modem. Fixed Wireless and two-way satellite are a more exotic but very 
intriguing solution. ISDN is a good choice if the cost is relatively low. One 
way cable may be a good fit in some situations - it is a reasonable compromise 
if the price is competitive - especially in rural areas. 
<P>A good place to research internet service choices is the web site 
www.isp.com. Another good source of information is to talk to your neighbors and 
others who have tried the various services. 
<P>Now that we have data into our home, we will explore how to distribute it 
around the home. </P></BODY></HTML>
