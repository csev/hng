<h3>Introduction</h3>
Since 1999, the growth in the number of multi-computer homes has outpaced the growth in the number of homes with at least one computer.  This means that increasingly as new computers are being purchased, the older computers are not being retired.  These older computers are being used to provide children with their own dedicated computer, putting computers at several locations thoughout the house for increased convienence.  Often a laptop from work will be borught home and used along side the home computer.
<p>
Fir a while, you might be willing to simply connect each computer to a phone jack and connect each to the Internet separately.  But this becomes frustrating very quickly.  A much better solution is to wire your home in a way which makes all of the computers connected to the Internet using a single connection.  With software and hardware solutions which dynamically make connections in an on-demand fashion, it is surprisingly easy to make Internet access second nature on all of the computers in the house at the same time.
<p>
In additoin, the ability to play games, share printers and files across that same network makes all of your computers more useful and fun to use.
<p>
It is surprisingly inexpensive to setup a basic home network.  In addition, it is easy to set up and maintain a home network with a shared internet connection.  In a way, it is a wonderful opportunity to larn about how computers and networking work.  Setting up a home network can develop skills that you can use at the workplace.  
<p>
This book takes the approach that the more that you know about how something works, the better you will be able to solve problems and make decisions.  We intend to teach you about how networking works in addition to giving instructions as to how to set up, install, and maintain your home network.  After you are done reading this books, you may know a few things that your network administrator at work does not know.
<p>
The book is intended to be readible from beginning to end.  Some topics may provide more detail than you feel is necessary, but it is good to know where to find the additional detail when diagnosing a problem or making a decision to make an upgrade or reconfigure your network.  Throughout most of the book, we have avoided "step by step" details to solve a particular problem.  Chapter 2 and the appendices contain the most specific guidance on setting up networks.  In the rest of the book, we mix the concepts which you need to understand to configure your network interspersed with some example screens selected to discuss the essential configuration aspects for that network feature.  We expect that you will be able to explore settings dialog boxes and understand most of the configuration options based on your broader understanding that you gain from the book.
<p>
Half of the battle in configuring a network is understanding the terminology used by the networking software vendors.  This is why it is important to skim the entire book.  For example in Chapter 11, we discuss solutions to providing filtered access to Internet content for children.  There are about 15 different products in this space, each with 20-30 configuration options.  It would not be practical to describe every screen and every option in this book - that is the purpose of the vendor documentation for each product.

By reading and understanding the terminology, you can understand the confiuration acreens and interpret the vendor documentation.  For example, say you are configuring some filtering software and are faced with a configuration screen asking whether nw how to fill in some configuration screen which has radio buttons to indicate whether you have a direct dial-up connection, proxy firewall or a NAT gateway.  This may seem like a foreign language to the beginning user, but having read chapters three through five, you will know the answer off the top of your head.  So by describing the terminolgy and underlying technology the vendor documentation becomes quite helpful instead of making you feel like you don't know anything.

<h3>Choosing Products</h3>
<p>
You will notice that there are no "product reviews" throughout the book.  We will often give a few starting points with pointers to specific products to help get you started in your product evaluation.  Just because we use a particular product as an example in the book, it does not mean that we are indicating that it is the "best" product.  In selecting the products which were used throughout the book, it was based on the evaluation of several products and we certainly chose one of the better products from the set we tested.    But you need to do your own evalution of software and hardware tools.    Some good sources for product review information include:
<ul>
<li>
ZDNet publiishes a number of computer and network related magazines which contain reviews of hardware and software products.  Their reviews are based on a throrough examination and testing of the products.  You can search for on-line reviews at www.zdnet.com
<li>
Rich - little help here :)
</ul>
Another good source of information is the vendor's web sites.  Before buying a product, look at the vendor's technical support web site.  If the vendor has good supporting documetation, it is a good indication .  Also look to see if there are new releases of the product or patches and improvements.    If you see new releases every 6-8 months, it is a very good indication that the company is comitted to fixing small problems and adding enhancements over time. 
<p>
Increasingly, software vendors in this area will allow a 30-day free trial of completely functional software.  There is no better way to evaluate software than to install and use it for a while.
<p>
<h3>Associated Web Site</h3>
<p>
The autors maintian a web site to support the book at www.homenetworkguys.com.  This site contains product reviews and recommendations as well as much more specific examples of configuring network components.  Because the web site can be quickly and easily updated it can contain more specific information which may go out of date.
<p>
The web site will contain additional reference material which was collected during in the writing of the book so you  can dive more deeply into certain topics.   We will also point to books which cover many of the topics in the book in much more detail as well.
<p>
The information will be organized in a way to add value to a book.  Information on the site will be associated with chapters of the book and provide more specific information to expand on a topic.
<p>
There will also be threaded discussion groups on the web site where you can interact with the authors and others working in home networking area.
<p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
At the end of the day, home networking is not just convienent and useful.  It is also fun.  For many people, learning about and researching their network is like working on a car.  For some, it can actually feel like a "hobby".   Many feel that enhanced communication and networking will be one of the strongest factors in changing our society and lives over the next 50 years.  Building and understanding your own home network allows you to explore this very important technology.
