<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" 
size=2>Spread spectrum technology was first introduced about 50 years ago by the 
military as a way of sending secure communications. From the beginning it was 
designed to be resistant to noise, interference, jamming, and unauthorized 
detection. Spread spectrum transmitters send their signals out over a multiple 
range of frequencies at very low power, in contrast to narrow band radios that 
concentrate all of their power into a single frequency. There are several ways 
to implement spread spectrum transmission, the techniques specified in the IEEE 
802.11 Wireless LAN standard are frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and 
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS).&nbsp; This white paper will discuss each 
of these spread spectrum techniques and highlight the pros and cons of 
each.</FONT></P>
<P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Some wireless local-area 
network products, such as Raytheon's Raylink<SUP>TM</SUP> products, use the 
frequency hopping method of spreading their signals. The range of available 
frequencies in the ISM2 (Industrial Scientific Medical) band of 2.400 - 2.483 
GHz is divided into a series of 1MHz channels up to 79 separate and distinct 
channels. Transmissions are sent over each of these channels in what appears to 
be a random sequence (called a “pseudo-random sequence”) such as channel 1, 
channel 32, channel 3, channel 56, etc. The radio switches frequencies many 
times a second, transmitting on each channel for a fixed amount of time, then 
proceeding on to the next channel in its sequence, covering all of the channels 
before repeating the sequence. Without knowing how long to stay on each channel 
(the “dwell time”) and what the hopping pattern is, it is impossible for a 
non-participating station to receive and decipher the data.</FONT></P><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><BR clear=all>The frequency hopping 
physical layer has 22 hop patterns to chose from. The frequency hopping physical 
layer is required to hop across the 2.4GHz ISM band covering 79 channels.&nbsp; 
Each channel occupies 1Mhz of bandwidth and must hop at the minimum rate 
specified by the regulatory bodies of the intended country.&nbsp; A minimum hop 
rate of 2.5 hops per second is specified for the United States. </FONT>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The DSSS physical layer uses 
an 11-bit Barker Sequence to spread the data before it is transmitted. Each bit 
transmitted is modulated by the 11-bit sequence. This process spreads the RF 
energy across a wider bandwidth than would be required to </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>transmit the raw data. The 
processing gain of the system is defined as 10x the log of the ratio of 
spreading rate (also know as the chip rate) to the data. The receiver despreads 
the RF input to recover the original data. The advantage of this technique is 
that it reduces the effect of narrowband sources of interference. This sequence 
provides 10dB of processing gain that meets the minimum requirements for the 
rules set forth by the FCC.&nbsp; The spreading architecture used in the direct 
sequence physical layer is not to be confused with CDMA.&nbsp; All 802.11 
compliant products utilize the same PN code and therefore do not have a set of 
codes available as is required for CDMA operation.</FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><B>Design and Cost 
Issues</B></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>Current 2 Mbps DSSS products 
on the market occupy 22 MHz of bandwidth at the first nulls of the main signal 
lobe. On the other hand, FHSS operates within 1 MHz of bandwidth as a 
consequence of a FCC mandate. As a result, the circuit design for the DSSS 
products requires very good passband characteristics for the 22 MHz width. Given 
a choice of 1 MHz versus 22 MHz, a 1Mhz design is easier to design.</FONT></P>

face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><I><SPAN>&nbsp;</SPAN>DSSS is 
typically chipped using BPSK modulation. Since BPSK modulation has both phase 
and amplitude information, linear amplification is necessary. That means only 
Class A or Class AB amplifiers can be used. These are relatively low efficiency 
amplifiers. A lot of the DC power is turned into thermal energy, which has to 
dissipate. FHSS typically uses GFSK modulation. This is constant-envelope 
modulation, so a non-linear, high efficiency Class C amplifier is adequate for 
its use. These characteristics mean that DSSS is more power hungry and harder to 
build in a smaller enclosure than FHSS systems. </I></FONT></P>
<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>In an indoor radio 
propagation environment, the measured delay spread statistics have shown that a 
100 nSec delay is fairly common. Since this is close to the </FONT></P>
<P class=MsoBodyText2><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><SPAN 
lang=EN-US>DSSS chipping rate, there is a potential for inter-chip interference 
- or in other words, a penalty for performance that may be as much as 10 dB over 
corresponding Gaussian Channel. Good diversity antennas must be used to overcome 
some of these problems. FHSS would not see the effects of the 100-nSec delay. 
For a strong narrow-band jammer environment, FHSS also has a marked advantage if 
it can avoid the jammed channel by its frequency hopping nature. If it can not 
avoid narrow band interference, FHSS systems will still degrade its performance 
gracefully. On the other hand, DSSS systems will immediately loose a connection 
with narrow band interference. </SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoBodyTextIndent style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><FONT 
face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>The FCC rule limits the 20-dB 
bandwidth of a hopping channel to be 1 MHz wide. To achieve a comparable DSSS 
data speed, FHSS must use M'ary modulation. The implementation difficulty is 
exponential. Furthermore, since the required signal to noise ratio (Eb/No) 
increases greatly for the same bit error rate (BER), the range is reduced. To 
compound the problem, FHSS has to give up inter-hop synthesizer settling time 
and demodulator lock-up time where no data transmission can be done. FHSS is 
also forced to hop within 400 msec. It has to use no less than 75 channels. This 
means that it is very difficult to get a FHSS system to do 2Mbps and there will 
be some extra overhead that will affect data throughput.&nbsp; On the other 
hand, DSSS can do high data rates relatively easily because it uses a larger 
amount of the bandwidth to pass the data (i.e. it uses a fatter pipe to move the 
data). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2><I>FHSS systems have 79 
channels with the 2.4Ghz ISM band.&nbsp; Because of the hopping sequences, many 
co-located networks can be deployed in the same area without interference and 
without the co-located networks intercepting the data.&nbsp; This allows for the 
network to be scaled based on an influx of users in a given area.&nbsp; FHSS 
systems are ideal for high user density areas such as a corporate office 
environment. </I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size=2>&gt;In conclusion, frequency 
hopping spread spectrum and direct sequence spread spectrum techniques are used 
in IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN systems because they are designed to be resistant to 
noise, interference, jamming, and unauthorized detection. Direct Sequence Spread 
Spectrum systems are much harder to build, has high user density limitations and 
typically costs more to build. It should always have a slight data speed 
advantages over frequency hopping systems and will have a range advantage. These 
systems are ideal for data warehouse applications where the data user density is 
small and range is a critical need.</FONT></P>

and be shorter in range. FHSS designs are easier to build and therefore cost 
less. They are very good at avoiding narrow band interference and unauthorized 
user access due to their frequency hopping nature.&nbsp; They are also scalable 
in that many separate networks can be co-located in the same area without 
interfering with each other.&nbsp; Frequency hopping spread spectrum systems are 
good for high user density areas such as corporate offices, education and 
healthcare applications.&nbsp; </FONT></P></DIV></BODY></HTML>
